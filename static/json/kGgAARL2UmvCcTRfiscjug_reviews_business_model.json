We went to the the back room and small patio area to join some friends who were part of a large party.  \n\nThere was hardly any room back there either and the server ignored us for most of the night.  We had to serve ourselves by going into the bar.  We also had to bus our own tables because nobody came out to clean up.  Also, the back room was very muggy and humid....this can't be the first time they've done large parties, right?!\n\nLike I said, I expected more out of this place and left disappointed.\n\nReturn Factor - 10%",

    "text": "I've driven past this place many times on the way to Suns or D-Backs games.  Every time I passed by, it looked like a fun place to go hang out.  I finally had the opportunity to do so during a conference in downtown Phoenix.  One of the companies at the conference hosted a party here.\n\nThe party was staged in the patio area as you enter the restaurant.  The company who hosted the party was giving away complimentary Cigars, so I understand why they had it outdoors.  The weather was perfect, so it was a good time of the year to do it.  The place was packed too.  So why the 2 Stars?  Here's why:\n\n- They serve Wine out of a liquor gun....yes, they do.  When I went up to the bar on the patio and asked for a glass of Cabernet, the bartender told me \"You have to go inside because we don't have the handles with the Wine\".....I thought she was kidding and I said, \"I'm sorry, I don't think you understand, I asked for a glass of Cabernet.  You don't have any bottles back there?\"....that's when she confirmed what I heard and said \"No, you heard me right, we serve Wine out of a handle/line and since we're a smaller bar outside you have to go inside to get it\".......what the hell?!  The Wine tasted like what you would expect Wine from a tap to taste like...\n\n- The restrooms are like gas station restrooms.  They're located out next to the bars on the patio and they are just like gas station restrooms in that they're too small and dirty.  They couldn't handle the crowd of people at the party.\n\n- Service is slow.  The line at the bar was 30 people deep for each line (2 lines).  There were only 2 bartenders to service 200+ people.  It took 20+ min to get a drink.\n\n- The party felt like a house party in someone's backyard.  Plastic cups, plastic furniture, you had to bus your own table.....there were no buspersons or anyone to clean up.  Bizzaro-world.....\n\nOverall, not a good experience.  Maybe if I was a young 20 yr old it would be cool...not now.\n\nReturn Factor - 5%",

Ok, so we drove up the driveway assuming that's where the valet parking would be located....and it was.  \n\nBeautiful views from the top of the hill.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-wrigley-mansion-club-phoenix?select=v_KnIKFpeibBVvefO6ujPA#v_KnIKFpeibBVvefO6ujPA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-wrigley-mansion-club-phoenix?select=7qDCP4mv_Ws2sdJtqmlvOA#7qDCP4mv_Ws2sdJtqmlvOA\n\nWe walked inside the mansion and were greeted by a hostess who directed us to the private event area to the left.  We enjoyed Wine and Cheese/Crackers/Fruit, etc that you normally find at a Wine tasting.  The Wine was very good and the room was comfortable.  After 30 min or so we were asked to move into the dining room area where we would start a formal Wine tasting with 8 glasses (4 White, 4 Red) of Wine.\n\nThe sommelier did a nice presentation about each Wine....however, she took too long and was a bit too in-depth for this group of people.  There were over 80 people and many of them were not Wine enthusiasts, so they were bored very quickly.....too much time between sips.  I personally enjoyed it, but afterward many people said it was too much info for them. \n\nSince the building is very old, the room we were in was not well insulated and got a little stuffy/warm....so if you're coming here during the Summer months, dress light.\n\nAfter the event, we wandered around the mansion and took a bunch of pics of the artwork and rooms.  I'm sure there's a story behind all of this, but we were on our own and didn't have a guide to explain anything to us.\n\nWe picked up a flyer for a social club you can belong to here...?  Not really sure what that entails, but it's available.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this experience 3.5 Stars, but I'm rounding up for the views and Wine.\n\nReturn Factor - 70%",

    "text": "Based on a recommendation from a friend, we've dined here a few times.  This Italian joint reminds me of the Peppermill Restaurant in Vegas.  The dining room walls are covered in mirrors and the furniture is black and white.  It's dimly lit and has an intimate feel to it.  During our visits, we've had the following menu items:\n\nEscargots, $11.50\n\nMozzarella Caprese, $12.00\n\nSpaghetti w/Meatballs & Sausage, $19.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-restaurant-of-distinction-phoenix?select=g6rybW0TkoO10ItXCbJDyg#g6rybW0TkoO10ItXCbJDyg\n\nTortellini, Lasagna, Gnocchi (custom made sampler appetizer)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-restaurant-of-distinction-phoenix?select=OnKBcxrDWW269Z9ZAQ0hRg#OnKBcxrDWW269Z9ZAQ0hRg\n\nTiramisu\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-restaurant-of-distinction-phoenix?select=BzrmZfblwrBYIB0-5JpAKw#BzrmZfblwrBYIB0-5JpAKw\n\nThe best part about our experience here is the service.  On one of our visits, when we asked the server if they had Gnocchi, he said \"We don't have it as a separate dish, but we can make something for you\".  The Better Half ordered a plate for dinner that evening.  On another visit, the server noticed that I was on the fence between the Lasagna, Gnocchi, and Tortellini....so he brought out a small sampler plate for me so I could try all 3 before I made my decision....awesome!\n\nAs far as the food, it's pretty good.  My fav's are the Gnocchi, Tortellini, and the Spaghetti.  You can't go wrong with any of them.\n\nReturn Factor - 87%",

The directional signs to guide you to your destination are non-existent.  However, once you reach your destination, you're in for a real treat.\n\nThe restaurant is perched on top of a ridge that overlooks part of the Phoenix Valley.  The view is spectacular!  The food is great too.  There was passed hors d'oeuvres at the beginning of the event that were very tasty.  Then just before the main speaker began, we were all seated for lunch.\n\nWe were served a Petite Filet and some Veggies with a light Citrus Salad as an appetizer.  Both were very good.  The servers were great.  They kept our water and Iced Tea glasses full throughout the lunch and promptly took away our dishes after each course.  For dessert, we had Cheesecake topped with Berries...it was delish!\n\nOverall, it was a very good luncheon.  If they hold one here again, I will definitely attend.  I will also come back for a dinner with The Better Half.\n\nReturn Factor - 88%",

They were a little sloppy making the Bean Burritos as they had red sauce on the outside of the tortilla....which makes for a sloppy meal.

We made reservations for 7 pm and when we arrived the place was slammed.  Everyone was trying to redeem their Groupon.  Because we had a reservation, we thought we were golden....nope, we ended up waiting for 45 min.  You could tell that the employees were super stressed.  I actually felt bad for them.  The food was very good and we wanted to give this place another chance, so we decided to come back another time when they weren't busy with Grouponers.\n\nSeveral months later we returned and had a normal dinner here.  The service was excellent and we had a much better experience than before.\n\nSome of the menu items we sampled:\n\nEscargots - $10.95\nCaprese Salad - $13.95\nStuffed Shells (Spinach & Ricotta) - $17.95\nLasagna - $17.95\n\nThe Better Half loved the Escargots.  She ordered it both visits.  I enjoyed the Stuffed Shells the first time and had the Lasagna on the second trip.  Between the two, the Stuffed Shells were my favorite.  I'm glad we came back for a second trip.\n\nReturn Factor - 85%",

The lady working the cash register could not multitask....it was agonizing.\n\nWhile waiting for my food, I went to the Salsa Bar to load up on Salsa.  Since I like spicy Salsa, I went for what appeared to be the spiciest one...turned out to be watered down, mild Gringo Juice...*bleh*.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix?select=VxCnEw9so_M2z8KJR1-vBw#VxCnEw9so_M2z8KJR1-vBw\n\nThe food came out after a long wait.  Customers were confused because the cashier was calling out the wrong orders and people were returning saying it wasn't what they ordered.  By this time, there were 8 or 9 of us waiting...it was a hot mess in there.\n\nI went for the Carne Asada Burrito first.  I took one bite and didn't like it...it was way too salty.  The Burrito was all Meat & a little Guac/Salsa combo...no Rice or Beans...that's a common recipe in some of these Taco shops.  Since there wasn't any other ingredients to soften the salty flavor, it was just bad.\n\nNext, I went for the Beans/Rice/Cheese (BRC) Burrito.  I took one bite and that one was bland.  I don't know if my taste buds were shot from the salty Carne Asada Burrito, but it wasn't good either.\n\nThe Salsa wasn't *meh* too and couldn't save it for me.  Towards the end of my meal, I noticed a guy speaking in Spanish to the cashier lady...she goes to the back and comes out with a couple of cups of \"spicier\" Salsa that was hidden in the back...dammit!  Secret menu I guess....\n\nThere are too many other good places in town, I won't be back here.\n\nReturn Factor - 0%",

While I was waiting, I went to the Salsa Bar to grab a few cups of their spicy Salsa.  The first item I ate was the Steak Street Taco....the meat was dry and Guacamole was bland.  I poured a lot of the Salsa on it to add flavor and give it some moisture.  Very disappointing.\n\nNext, I had the Burrito.  That was dry too!  Even with the Sour Cream in the Burrito, it was dry...the Steak, Rice, Beans...all was dry.  Needless to say, I used a heavy dose of Salso on that as well.  To make it worse, the Chips that came with the Burrito were 1/2 fresh & crispy and 1/2 were covered in oil or stale...so they were chewy...that means they combined new, fresh Chips with a batch of old ones....bummer.\n\nOne positive thing is that the service here was outstanding.  The cashier was very friendly and had a nice, welcoming smile.  I also watched a customer complain that one of the sodas was out of syrup on the machine....the employee sincerely apologized and quickly remedied the situation by replacing the empty container with a new one.\n\nI'll have to come back and give this place another try, it may have been an off day for them.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%",

They were good and had decent flavor.  The Guac and Sour Cream come in small cups so you have to dip your Chips in them or take a knife to put on your Chips....I don't prefer to eat my Nachos that way.\n\nThe Philly Cheesesteak was pretty good too....far from the best I've ever had, but decent.\n\nThere were plenty of TV's in the restaurant, so we were able to keep apprised of the hockey/football games on the tube.\n\nWe had to flag down the server for refills of the Beer....that was the one downside to the visit was the service.

While I was waiting for my food, someone told me about a free car show they host in the parking lot every Saturday night.\n\nMy food was ready and I had a decent lunch.  It's McDonalds, so my expectations are pretty low.  Not bad for a quick meal.\n\nI then returned the next Saturday night to check out the car show.....it was pretty cool!  There are probably close to 100 cars here....everything from old classics (Chevy's, Corvettes, Camaros, Mustangs) to newer rice rockets (Acuras, Hondas, Toyotas) to exotics (Ferrari's, Lambos).  I was amazed!  Best part....it's FREE!\n\nBy the way.....the McDonalds was packed and making tons of money.....great idea!\n\nReturn Factor - 100% (the Car show was a lot of fun, will definitely be back)",

It's so much fun and it's free.\n\nThey get a bump up in stars because over the past 2 yrs, they've delivered great customer service and the food is always fresh by fast food standards.  Also, McDonald's has stepped up it's menu and offered a variety of new items that are tasty and unique.  Their Iced Coffee is very good...and I'm not a Coffee drinker.\n\nI come here primarily for breakfast and an occasional lunch....and the car shows.\n\nIf you have a free Saturday night and like cars, give it a try....especially during the nice weathered months.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

Since I hadn't had Meat for a while, I was looking forward to this dinner.\n\nAfter browsing the menu, I decided to go for the Porcini Rubbed Filet Mignon (center cut, grilled high country Asparagus\nspears, Gorgonzola Cream Sauce).  For a side dish, I selected the Chipotle Mac & Cheese.  My friends ordered a bottle of Wine and we were good to go!\n\nThe Filet was soooo good!  The Gorgonzola Cream Sauce added a rich, creamy flavor to the succulent center cut Filet.  I requested it Medium and it was cooked to perfection.  The Chipotle Mac & Cheese was a perfect complement to the Filet.....I highly recommend it.\n\nThe service was pretty good to.  Our glasses of Wine were never empty and we ordered a Chocolate Lava Cake w/Vanilla Ice Cream & Whipped Cream and split it between the 3 of us.  It was awesome!\n\nOverall, it was a great dinner with good friends.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

I ordered an Italian Sub & a Pizza Puff.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6zincCvQTb9BsuK-GHZ4cw?select=Bb3c9tM6uvXJmgaiT9B8eA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6zincCvQTb9BsuK-GHZ4cw?select=32uwfuBXI-ig7g6METKPKA\n\nThe Italian Sub was served hot and came out first.  I kind of wish the Pizza Puff came out at the same time because it takes a little while for the Pizza Puff to cool off....but that's ok.\n\nThe Italian Sub was very good.  It was a nice sized portion, not too big & not too small, just right for lunch.  The Deli Meats are tasty served hot and the Bread was very good!\n\nThe Pizza Puff was brought out to me a short time later.  I couldn't wait to take a bite....hmmmm, it's just like they serve them in Chicago.  If you've never had a Pizza Puff, do yourself a favor and go out and try one as soon as possible....You'll be glad you did!\n\nOverall, it was a nice lunch, satisfying my taste for Chicago.  They also serve Pizza and Dog's here, so I will be back!\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

    "text": "Had this place bookmarked after watching Adam Richman eat a dozen sliders on Man vs Food.  Since I was in the area I decided to stop by for lunch.  The place was packed and I had to wait a few minutes to be seated. While I was waiting I browsed the Bakery side of the joint.  I didn't realize it was a Bakery & a Deli.\n\nThe Bakery had a ton of awesome looking Desserts....I almost scrapped lunch in favor of a Dessert or two, ha!  But my name was called and I went to be seated.\n\nThe food menu is pretty large and I had a tough time selecting a dish.  I asked my server for her opinion and she suggested trying the Sliders and making a combo with the Original Jewish Sliders (Mini Challah Rolls, Brisket, Potato Pancakes, Jack Cheese, Brown Gravy) and the Western Sliders (Mini Challah Rolls, BBQ Brisket, Cheddar Cheese, Onion Strings).....there would be 3 Sliders of my choice and Fries for $11.99.  I decided to go for it and ordered the combo with 1 Original Jewish Slider and 2 BBQ Beef Sliders.\n\nAfter a short wait my food came out.  I couldn't wait to dive into it.  I went for the Jewish Slider first.  I've never had anything like this before.....it was dripping with Gravy.  Took one bite and could taste the Gravy, Potato Pancake, and Jack Cheese immediately....then I could taste the Brisket, which was very moist.  It was pretty good, but I'm not a big fan of Gravy unless it's Thanksgiving.\n\nNext I went for the BBQ Brisket Sliders......they were very tasty.  The proportion of BBQ Sauce and Onion Strings were just right to give it that Sweet & Tangy flavor.  Of the two types of Sliders I prefer the BBQ Sliders over the Jewish Sliders.  The Fries were Breaded Wedge Cut Fries and were awesome......crispy on the outside and moist & soft on the inside.  The spices on the Fries were very good too.\n\nOverall, it was a good meal.  My server was very friendly and checked up on me often to make sure I was satisfied with my meal.  She offered to replace the Jewish Slider if I didn't like it.  I told her that it was good and then she suggested Pumpkin Creme Brulee for Dessert.  I wasn't planning on Dessert, but couldn't resist and said yes.  It came out and the portion was pretty big.....there was no way I could finish it but I gave it a good shot and ate 1/2 of it.  It was very flavorful and gave my meal a nice Holiday Touch.\n\nI enjoyed my meal here and got my money's worth.\n\nWill I return?  You bet.....I might actually give that 12 Slider Challenge a shot if I'm in the mood.",

Seduced by this claim, I had to give this place a try.  Of course, my first time there I had to try this legendary Sandwich.  Priced at $20, it better be good...\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/houstons-scottsdale?select=U0ixpfN85zASG-5U8eBq1w#U0ixpfN85zASG-5U8eBq1w\n\nI took one bite and OMG...!  It was friggin' awesome!  Even better than I expected.  The flavor of the Prime Rib and the Au Jus sent my taste buds into the stratosphere.  It also comes with a Creamy Horseradish Sauce that just adds to the flavor explosion.  The Bread is Buttered and soft, but had just the right texture to hold this all together and complimented the sharp flavors of the Beef and Sauce.  Wow, it is a masterpiece.\n\nThe service here is also impeccable.  You feel like you're dining in a 5 diamond restaurant....and it's lunch!\n\nI was so impressed after that 1st visit, that I've been back several times and have brought many friends and colleagues to experience the French Dip.\n\nMy other favorite item is the Hickory Burger (Canadian Bacon, Cheddar Cheese, Onion, w/Hickory Sauce), $14.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/houstons-scottsdale?select=CYjS0T6wl1Pe9fX_-DV9mw#CYjS0T6wl1Pe9fX_-DV9mw\nThat's right folks, there's a thick slice of Canadian Bacon that tops this Burger!  This is a big bad Burger....and it tastes awesome!  I can barely take a bite out of it....and it's not like some freakishly huge Burger, but the ingredients are fresh and stacked high....making for an awesome Burger.\n\nFor sides, the Cole Slaw is by far the best you can order and I highly recommend that.  The Fries are so/so.  \n\nAnother tip, if you come for lunch you can make reservations.  It can get busy, so it's worth the extra step to do so.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

The Omelet was cooked well, not runny....which is a good thing.  The only thing I didn't like about the Omelet was the Mushrooms....they were definitely canned and not cut fresh...other than that, it was a solid Omelet.\n\nThe Hash Browns were OK, and the Sourdough Toast was very good....should have asked for it dry, but forgot to do that.

    "text": "I've stopped by this Deli for lunch and breakfast.  When I came for lunch, I ordered a 10\" Italian Sandwich ($6.79)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA?select=FvhTfKVsGt5FXtfjL7dgEw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA?select=qaOSRK-FMOUZgooSqY8R4w\n\nThe Sandwich was very difficult to eat because it was served open-faced with the Meat pushing the Bread open....very strange as it made it difficult to fold back over and hold.  Also, they douse the bread with the Oil/Vinegar, so it gets soggy and breaks apart....WTH?  The taste was pretty good, but the experience sucked.  You can see what I'm talking about in my pics.\n\nThe 2nd time I stopped here, it was to try their Breakfast Burritos.....since the Max Burro was priced at $4.29, I only ordered 1 because I thought it would be huge....I was wrong, it was just a Med sized Burrito.  It was pretty good....Eggs, Bacon, Cheese, wrapped in a Tortilla.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA?select=8gpyTOcWz6BWYTxxTc-UnA\nI was disappointed with the size though.....I was still hungry after I finished it....bummer.  I didn't think the $4.29 was worth it...I think $3.50 would be a more appropriate price for a Med sized Breakfast Burrito.\n\nOverall, I think this place has potential....right now, it only gets 3 Stars from me.\n\nReturn Factor - 67%",

There's a Ferarri Testarossa parked under a small canopy as you enter the restaurant....very retro/cool, was expecting to see Tom Selleck in the restaurant...LOL  Actually, it's pretty cool.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=XwbYXd3iwsRqfRCqoIk6iQ#XwbYXd3iwsRqfRCqoIk6iQ\n\nThe place was packed when we arrived, good thing we had reservations via Open Table.  We were seated immediately and the hostess gave us our menus.  After browsing the menu for a while, we decided to order:\n\nCaprese Salad, $7.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=y_S90tz4lU_fgT_T95lddg#y_S90tz4lU_fgT_T95lddg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=a9fJ6UZMgXszy-WnM7PSHw#a9fJ6UZMgXszy-WnM7PSHw\n\nGnocchi w/Gorgonzola Cream Sauce, $14.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=oGN8sA5ntpHdRBq7StXhMQ#oGN8sA5ntpHdRBq7StXhMQ\n\nRavioli Caprese Gratinati (filled with Ricotta Cheese, topped with Parmesan & Mozzarella), $14.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=ZkCB534PV_uxiPYIoK_UfA#ZkCB534PV_uxiPYIoK_UfA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=ES6PjDeRka7wgDOiBnKh5g#ES6PjDeRka7wgDOiBnKh5g\n\nChoccamisu, $7.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=dBvd4nd5-k_Rz7wuR1RIuw#dBvd4nd5-k_Rz7wuR1RIuw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=maK0iPmrp8DDWIbAxK-J-Q#maK0iPmrp8DDWIbAxK-J-Q\n\nIt took a while to order our Wine and food.  They were busy and our waiter had his hands full, so the hostess came by our table and took our Wine order....that was a good thing, kept us distracted...LOL  While were waiting, a busser brought out some Bread and Oil for us...the Oil was a little different than most Italian joints...it had chunks of Tomato and green herbs & spices in it...almost like a Salsa (see pic below).  It was very good.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=pr4ZJ1w3FnvFdudt0TlzAQ#pr4ZJ1w3FnvFdudt0TlzAQ\n\nWe ordered our food and after a short wait it came out.  The Caprese Salad appetizer was very good and perfect for 2 people to share.  The portion size was just right and we didn't get full before our entrees came out.\n\nA short time later, the entrees came out.  I sampled a little Gnocchi from The Better Half...it was very, very good...yum!  I had the Ravioli....they were cooked perfectly al dente...the Tomato Sauce was homemade with fresh ingredients and full of flavor.\n\nAfter dinner, we were surprised with a complimentary shot of Limoncello from our waiter.  He said it was to help cleanse the palate for Dessert...great!  He read our mind...we ordered a Chocamisu to split for Dessert.  It came out a short time later and was heavenly...soft, creamy, sweet just like it's supposed to be.\n\nOverall, we were very pleased with our visit to Arrivederci.  We can't wait to come back soon.\n\nReturn Factor - 95%",

We then got our groove on and danced to country & classic rock songs.  The bar also filled up and there was a nice crowd there.  We all had a blast and worked off the calories we ate.\n\nWe heard they have country dance lessons on Wednesdays, so we'll be back.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

During our visits, I've had the following items:\n\nMozzarella Caprese & Bruschetta, $9.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=or8bZj8bwnbM9IyObpUuRA#or8bZj8bwnbM9IyObpUuRA\n\nCalamari, $10.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=77WwI7Ut1lSoKKMR25xw4Q#77WwI7Ut1lSoKKMR25xw4Q\n\nBreaded Ravioli, $7.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=rrlu2zLgF8f-tFhw3bvVjw#rrlu2zLgF8f-tFhw3bvVjw\n\nCheese Ravioli, $15.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=PnHlTuqTJksi0c1XDFKG9g#PnHlTuqTJksi0c1XDFKG9g\n\nCannelloni Fiorentino & Gnocchi (Baked Pasta filled with braised Veal, Chicken and Wild Mushrooms with Potato and Ricotta Pasta Dumplings), $22.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=jdDIvDXs1Q0WV1ovGqDDmQ#jdDIvDXs1Q0WV1ovGqDDmQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=O9MptWALjOVNfDTKvLuNxA#O9MptWALjOVNfDTKvLuNxA\n\nTortellini con Ricotta (Tortellini with saut\u00e9ed Mushrooms in a Cream Sauce and Parmigiano Cheese), $18.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=1FSj93ZjHABis7iarBfWxA#1FSj93ZjHABis7iarBfWxA\n\nGnocchi w/Cream Sauce & Cheese (special order), $18.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=Vez8LJdi8YULSbMPATRT_A#Vez8LJdi8YULSbMPATRT_A\n\nVeal Scaloppini alla Parmigiana (Herb Veal Scaloppini baked with a Tomato Herb Sauce & Mozzarella Cheese served with Penne Marinara & Vegetable of the day), $29.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=hm_q9fzAdOPjt0powPL1Dg#hm_q9fzAdOPjt0powPL1Dg\n\nStuffed Shells w/Vegetables, $20.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=J9vXuJUV2V5mxfyY4mlczA#J9vXuJUV2V5mxfyY4mlczA\n\nChocolate Lava Souffle (Cocoa-soaked Sponge Cake with a rich molten warm Godiva Chocolate center w/Vanilla Ice Cream), $8.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=k2R5CnbA-ySqckl2aijSuw#k2R5CnbA-ySqckl2aijSuw\n\nThe Gnocchi is outstanding.  We like it so much that we ask for a special order of Gnocchi w/Cream Sauce & Gorgonzola Cheese as an appetizer and the chef always obliges....that's great customer service!\n\nBesides the Gnocchi, my fav dishes here are the Stuffed Shells and the Tortellini con Ricotta.  The Stuffed Shells are a special menu item and it isn't always available.  The rest of the menu items I've tried are pretty good as well.\n\nThe customer service here is very good.  There are a couple of fun waiters who are always smiling and cracking jokes with you....they're also attentive to your dining needs.  Overall, it's a good dining experience.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

    "text": "A friend of mine introduced me to this place several years ago before I moved here.  Since I moved here, we've dined here three times.  It's a fun, casual place to take your family and enjoy bar food.  Here's a breakdown of what I've had:\n\nPhilly Cheesesteak Sandwich (Whole, $14.95) - Really good.  The Bread is decent and the Whole sized portion is enough for 2 people.\n\nUncle Sam's Special Pizza (18\" Large, $23.95) - It has virtually every topping on it.  Because it's crammed with toppings, it tends to get a little soggy even if it's ordered well done, which is how I order it.  Flavor is pretty good.  We always take a few slices home and it heats up well for leftovers.\n\nWings (Baker's Dozen, $7.95) - Our friends don't like the really spicy stuff, so we always order the Medium spice level and the Spicy on the side.  The Wings are really good.  Always served hot and they break away from the bone well.  The Spicy sauce isn't too Spicy....I like spicy food, so it's about average for me.\n\nLarge basket of Fries $3.23 - Decent sized basket.  Can serve 2-3 people.  Average flavor, reminds me of Wendy's Fries in terms of size and style.\n\nLarge basket of Fried Zucchini $4.95 - Can serve 2-3 people.  The flavor is average.  Always served hot and crispy.  I've never had soggy Zucchini here, which is a pet peeve.\n\nThe restaurant has plenty of seating and can easily accommodate a large group.  During one visit we had 8 people and it was very comfortable.  The Happy Hour here is pretty good, but I've never been able to try it because I'm always working.  The wait staff is young and relatively inexperienced, so you have to stay on top of them...however, that's to be expected in a restaurant like this.\n\nOverall, we enjoy this place and will definitely return.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

We use to eat at a Macaroni Grill for lunch all the time, but in recent years have ignored it.\n\nI have a favorite dish....the Pasta Milano (Roasted Chicken, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Mushrooms, Farfalle Pasta in a roasted Garlic Cream Sauce, $11.99).....but I got it without Chicken since I'm on a no Meat diet.\n\nThe Better Half ordered the Crusted Sole (Filet of Sole topped w/Lemon Butter & served w/Sun-Dried Tomato, Spinach Orzo, $14.99).\n\nI didn't like my Pasta Milano.....the Cream Sauce was very watery and didn't have much flavor....bland, which has never happened to me when I've ordered it.\n\nThe Better Half enjoyed her Sole, but didn't think it was anything beyond average.\n\nMy friend ordered the King Salmon ($17.99) and enjoyed it.\n\nIf I was rating this dinner on my experience alone, it would have been 2 Stars....but since the other two dining with me enjoyed their meal, I'm bumping it up to 3.  The service was so/so.....young wait staff here with plenty to learn about service....I didn't ding them because of their inexperience.  They were pleasant and sincere....which goes a long way with me.\n\nReturn Factor - 30%",

We were lucky to snag a table for 4 after only a short 10 minute wait.  However, several people ahead of us left because of the wait.  The other 2 visits here were no problem, but that was because it was 4+ weeks later and the Groupon rush was over.\n\nAfter 3 visits, here's my breakdown of the joint:\n\n+We enjoy the Mom & Pop feel to the place.  It's cozy and comforting.\n\n+The food is pretty good.  I've had the Pancakes, Breakfast Burrito, and Waffle.  All very very good.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/V81Ahkb9QFlbEx4PoeRiyA?select=rFCTC-tGavGymtsmc-ddHQ\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/V81Ahkb9QFlbEx4PoeRiyA?select=MV3p0qgtMtc0j2wg-rItQA\n\n+There's Gluten-Free options.  The Better Half enjoys those options even though she's not allergic to Gluten.\n\n-The Coffee is terrible.  Watered down.\n\n-The prices are a bit high, but considering the quality of the food isn't too bad.  Just don't expect to come in and get Denny's or IHOP pricing.  Let's just say I'm glad I had the Groupon.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our visits here.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%",

The Hot Link was actually spicy, which is often not the case.  The Potatoes were very tasty as well.  My only complaint was that it was kind of a small portion...I was left wanting more.\n\nMy server was very friendly and welcoming.  She asked how I found the joint and addressed me by name when I left....very cool.\n\nReturn Factor - 98%",

The distinct flavor of the Onions & Mustard in the Burger brought back memories.  The Chicken Strip Sandwich was above average, which surprised me.  The Chicken is real, White Meat Chicken Breast, and the BBQ Sauce was decent.  The Fries were just OK.\n\nOverall, it was an OK meal for a fast food joint.\n\nReturn Factor - 71%",

I prefer it with a thicker consistency and spicier.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ajo-als-scottsdale?select=BVcuBjkGkzOq6aCuT79B3g#BVcuBjkGkzOq6aCuT79B3g\n\n....so I asked for the real deal Spicy Salsa, and they went to the kitchen and brought it out for me, which was awesome.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ajo-als-scottsdale?select=V-gPwFtgugPtMDkWlWITog#V-gPwFtgugPtMDkWlWITog\n\nThe Better Half ordered the Mushroom Enchiladas, which she absolutely loved.  She's a Mushroom fan, so this dish worked out well for her.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ajo-als-scottsdale?select=LKdOTSLvDBup108Tu3574Q#LKdOTSLvDBup108Tu3574Q\n\nI decided to order the 1/2 Plate of Nachos....I'm a Nacho lover, but wasn't expecting the gigantic portion which was labeled \"1/2 Order\".....1/2?!  I'd hate to see what a \"full\" plate looked like!!  LOL  It was a pleasant surprise and I took it as a challenge to finish it, which I did to the amazement of our server...TBH wasn't too happy though and the tables around us were laughing when they saw it delivered to me, LOL.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ajo-als-scottsdale?select=eyUIpaHaw8wsgbqlX1y5XA#eyUIpaHaw8wsgbqlX1y5XA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ajo-als-scottsdale?select=8Xor4v7BBwS-0dCqOeRWZA#8Xor4v7BBwS-0dCqOeRWZA\n\nOverall, this was a fun place to have dinner and the food was a shy over 3 Stars.  Servers here are accommodating and pleasant, which earned the 4th Star.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",

I followed his advice and it paid off.  The Sandwich is stuffed full of the ingredients and is quite messy to handle.  If it wasn't cut in half, it would've been even messier.\n\nThe Sandwich tasted pretty good and the Bread was also above average.  Their house brand Chips were also above average and had a unique taste to them...to me they were almost like Sour Cream & Onion more than Jalapeno.\n\nOverall, a good lunch experience.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",

I tried to eat it, but could only muster a few bites.  So, I went to the Pizza....\n\nAs most of my Yelp friends know, I love Pizza....so I couldn't wait to give it a try.  I took a bite and was thoroughly disappointed.  It was bland and had that dreaded \"cardboard\" texture to it....damn!  Strike 2!\n\nI paid my bill and left disappointed.\n\nReturn Factor - 30%......I might come back to shoot some pool and have drinks with friends.  For the food....probably not.",

    "text": "I tried to take the family here for dinner 3 times.  Each time, we were told the wait was 30+ minutes.  Since I hate waiting and they don't take reservations, we passed and went somewhere else.  On the 4th attempt, The Better Half went ahead of time to put our name on the list so that I could join them later when we got seated....it worked perfectly.  I was in a business meeting and she timed it perfectly so that I was able to make it right after my meeting.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nAppetizers\nSpinach Artichoke Dip\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=kmUXZrIRtqqJbOxfJeksrw\nSweet Potato Fries\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=0FNCsaKdjoPOayWsFC8x5w\n\nPizzas\n10\" Thin Crust - Onions, Green Peppers, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Jalapenos, Mushrooms, Gorgonzola Cheese\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=dD0jzKpj2Oh-eaE7sVvLZw\n8\" Thick Crust - Pepperoni, Sausage\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=VxSsA7mn7xU0QCmvjHrfUg\n10\" Thick Crust - Anchovies, Mushrooms, Gorgonzola Cheese, Onions\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=HOLWbqCsw7-cPBoyFTY19Q\n\nYeah....we were hungry!  We ordered too much food and had to take a lot of it home.\n\nThe Pizzas were cooked well done, per our request.  We enjoy well done Pizza.  Because the ingredients are fresh, it took 45 minutes for the Pizzas to come out.  I had the Thin Crust.  After such a long wait, I had high expectations....unfortunately, I was disappointed.  It was just OK.  The Crust didn't have much flavor and the ingredients, while fresh, didn't hit my taste buds on a positive note.....damn.\n\nThe rest of the family felt the same way about their Pizzas.  Kiddo had the Thick Crust Pepperoni & Sausage....he too is a Pizza lover like me and he said his was just OK.  Mom & The Better Half had the other Pizza and they too were underwhelmed.\n\nThe Appetizers were the highlight of the evening.  The Spinach Artichoke Dip was delish & the Sweet Potato Fries were awesome.\n\nOverall, it was an average dining experience.  Was it worth the long wait to get in, then the long wait to get your Pizza?  No.\n\nReturn Factor - 10%",

The Sausage had a nice balance of flavors...slightly sweet, but very good.  The Jalapenos are on the spicy side, which is how I like it.....for some people, it may be too much.\n\nOverall, it was a solid Pizza.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

The bartenders, servers, and managers are super friendly and always stop by to say hello at our table.\n\n+ The food.  Pizza, Wings, Sandwiches, Burgers....we've had so many things on the menu, It's hard to figure out which one is our favorite.  If I had to pick a couple, it would be the Fuh-getta-bout-it Pizza and the Turkey Bacon Melt.....seriously though, the food is superb.\n\n+ They have a cool patio area.  There's a large AC unit out back and misters to keep you cool during the summer months and a heater to keep you warm during the winter.  The patio is the place to be sometimes.\n\n+ The offer a complimentary shuttle to drive you home.  Don't want to drive?  No problem, call up KO's to pick you up.  Had a little too much to drink and don't want a DUI?  No problem, ask them to take you home and they'll do it free of charge.  There's of course a radius of how far they'll drive, but if you live nearby you're in the zone.\n\nOverall, this is a solid bar that we love coming to on a regular basis.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

Let me explain......\n\nFast Food Elements\n+ You order at a counter, menu on boards against the wall.\n\n+ They call for your number & you pick up your food at the counter....food is served on plastic plates & trays, like many fast food restaurants.\n\n+ Food comes out relatively fast.\n\n+ Self Serve Salsa Bar\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emtAyZPvp_0b40levOzcnA?select=bJL2f4dqLkQZePWU13UCsw\n\nFull Service Restaurant Elements\n+There's bar seating w/Alcohol service.\n\n+ Food quality is a notch above Fast Food.\n\n+ Food prices are nearly the same as full service restaurants.\n\n+ Complimentary Chips & Salsa.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emtAyZPvp_0b40levOzcnA?select=0LCjnbhWGXS6ZMtp_137eA\n\nI've been here a few times....being on my no Meat diet, I have some good choices here.\n\nBean & Cheese Burrito, $5.49\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emtAyZPvp_0b40levOzcnA?select=hJcWsnkgB9Br9ZnpFV7NLA\n\nNachos w/Cheese & Beans, *Hint* Get the Kid's Meal for $4.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emtAyZPvp_0b40levOzcnA?select=yrX3FWg6cyzFNi5HvQuwEA\n\nQuesadilla, $4.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emtAyZPvp_0b40levOzcnA?select=OgFy34v2UTeOvSSc4ffy0g\n\nThe food is pretty good....not great.  I enjoy coming here to grab a quick bite.  The other big bonus for me is that they have Arizona Gunslinger Hot Sauce available here....\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emtAyZPvp_0b40levOzcnA?select=FJbrO9TXOs5J-gp_psFn0w\nThis Hot Sauce packs a nice punch and I pour it generously on my food....yum!\n\nOverall, it's not a bad joint......way better than Taco Bell, just under Full Service joints.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

After browsing the menu, I decided to get a Popper Burger (Sauteed Jalapenos, Onion Straws, Cream Cheese, $9.50) and to wash it down a Four Peaks IPA.\n\nThe Burger didn't disappoint, it was very good!  The combination of Jalapenos & Cream Cheese made this Burger unique and tasty.....with a little *kick*, just how I like it.  The Four Peaks IPA was a perfect match for it as well....yum!\n\nI sat at the bar and the bartender/server was very friendly and helpful.  Can't wait to come back.\n\nReturn Factor - 97%",

Here's why:\n\n+ The course is well kept year round.\n+ The greens are in great condition.\n+ They don't slam the course with too many players.\n+ There's lots of wildlife on the course.  When I played, we saw a Bobcat, Coyote, and Hawk.\n+ The course is challenging, but fun for all handicaps.\n\nOverall, despite shooting poorly, I enjoyed the golf outing.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

    "text": "Easily one of my favorite golf courses in Arizona, Troon North is a blast.  The course is modern, well designed, and well kept.  I've played in several charity tournaments here and personal rounds of golf with friends and colleagues.  The Monument Course is my fav of the two.  Very picturesque and full of wildlife.  We've seen rattlesnakes, hawks, rabbits, coyotes, roadrunners, various types of birds, and bobcats while on the golf course....amazing!\n\nThe clubhouse meeting room is kind of small though.  Post tournament lunches and ceremonies are kind of cramped.  Parking can get tight if the tournament is large and well attended, so get there early if you're playing in a tourney.\n\nIn the summertime, it's blazing hot and it's a desert course, so not much shade to cool off at on the tee box.\n\nStaff here is always friendly and professional.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

The parking lot was packed and we had to wait around 10 min for our table....this was at 12:10 pm, the worst time to be heading to lunch.  The wait was worth it though.\n\nOnce we were seated we browsed the menu and decided to order the Queso Fundido w/Chorizo appetizer ($6.95), Beef & Bean Chimichanga lunch special ($8.25), and Pollo Amador lunch special ($10.25).  I also asked the waiter if the cook could put together a really spicy Habanero Salsa for us....he said sure.  \n\nWe were served complimentary Chips, Salsa, and Beans while we waited for our food....+1.  The Salsa reminded me of the Salsa at Lindo/Bonito Michoacan.  I read the menu that had the story of Zapata, but couldn't find any connection between the restaurants.....the Salsa was that close to one another.  Anyway, it was really good.....had a nice kick to it.  The Chips weren't as fresh as I like them to be....but they were good.\n\nAfter a short wait our Queso Fundido came out....again, it reminded me of the one at Lindo/Bonito Michoacan.  It was very delicious.  On top of the dish is an extremely hot Pepper....I think it's a grilled Jalapeno or Poblano (see pics)....whatever it is, I like it.\n\nI ordered the Beef & Bean Chimichanga and it came out a few minutes later....along with the Habanero Salsa.  The Beef was shredded and very delicious, not greasy.  Sometimes when you order a Beef Chimichanga it can be very greasy....not here.  It was a nice size too.....must be their lunch portion.  The Habanero Salsa was really spicy....just how I like it!  It added to the flavor.  My dish also came with Guacamole & Sour Cream and a side of Refried Beans & Rice.....all very good.\n\nMy Son enjoyed his Pollo Amador.  He gave me a bite to try it out.  It is Chicken marinated in Amador Sauce (whatever that is).  The Sauce had a slightly sweet tomatoey flavor to it.....it was very good.\n\nOverall, it was a nice lunch.\n\nWill we return?  If we're in the area and in the mood for some Mexican Food....you can count on it.",

    "text": "Friends from So Cal were visiting and wanted to come here.  One of them is a FOB Vietnamese (she calls herself that!) and has dined here before.  Her boyfriend also loves the place and so do I, so we had lunch yesterday.\n\nI had the Beef Fried Rice, she had I the Sweet & Sour Pork Chops, and I don't know what her boyfriend had, but it looked good.  All of the dishes were excellent.  We didn't leave hungry, that's for sure!\n\nThe only strike against this place is that the servers here seem so unfriendly.  They don't say hello, have a mean look on their face all the time, and when my friend asked for chopsticks, the server gave her a mean look and pointed to the chopsticks on the table....she obviously didn't see it, but it was the way he handled it that was shocking.  The funny part is that she's Vietnamese, so you would think they would treat Gringo's like that, but not their own....whatever.  They only get 3 Stars because of the service.\n\nWill I return?  Pho-gettah 'bout it, of course!",

However, the service here is still weird....servers are still miserable and unfriendly...I've come to accept it as fact that they don't like us because we're not Vietnamese.  Combine that with all of the drunks that come in here during the late night and early morning hours and they have a generally bad disposition to outsiders coming to eat here.  It's become part of the lore that is Pho Kim Long....at least amongst our friends.\n\nMy fav dish here is the Beef Combo Pho....so good, I can eat it morning/noon/night...yum!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-kim-long-las-vegas?select=Ol7fB974HymWXQ78uFPANQ#Ol7fB974HymWXQ78uFPANQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-kim-long-las-vegas?select=ruo_rjf7rAcCUu3jPKb3bw#ruo_rjf7rAcCUu3jPKb3bw\n\nAs long as they keep serving up great Pho, I'll be back.\n\nReturn Factor - 98%",

When you order your entree, you tell the waiter how spicy you want your food on a scale from 1-10 with 10 being the spiciest level.  I generally get a 5 or 6.\n\nService - The employee to customer ratio in this restaurant is pretty high.  My guess is that they don't make very much in terms of an hourly wage.

    "text": "Ok, so I was in the mood for authentic Mexican food today and wanted to try something new....so I headed towards the hood.  I figured I'd find something good there.\n\nAs I passed by Pepe's, I've seen this place a 1000 times since I've lived in Vegas, but never stopped.  I did today.\n\nIt was pretty busy in the restaurant and I was glad to see a typical menu for a taco shop....reminds me of when I lived in SoCal.  I ordered a Carne Asada Burrito and a bottle of Mexican Orange Soda....I love their soda because it's made with Natural Sugar and not High Fructose Corn Syrup.\n\nAnyway, my burrito came out and I was pleased to see it was a good size...not too big and not too small.  I went to the salsa bar and got some of their spicy red salsa.  The burrito was ok....I thought the Carne Asada was too salty, but it had good flavor....the beans were good....the rice was dry....and the salsa in the burrito was ok.\n\nOverall, the experience didn't blow me away.  It was a good visit, but not the one I was hoping for.  I guess next time, I'll have to go deeper into the hood.\n\nWill I return?  eh...not sure.",

We like the atmosphere....it reminds me a lot of the restaurants on the East Coast or in Chicago....dark, brick walls, etc.  The wine selection is great.....we usually do a wine tasting of Chardonnay (fiance) and Cabernet (for me) along with dinner.  \n\nThe prices are very reasonable and the outdoor patio seating is a great option during the Spring/Fall.  Winter and Summer can be a little uncomfortable.  I definitely recommend reservations as the wait can be long and there isn't much room for waiting around near the bar or hostess stand.  Our favorite dishes there are the appetizer sampler and the bowtie pasta w/chicken breast.  Very fun and moderate on the budget.",

    "text": "***This review is for the bar counter service only***\n\nThis is a really hard review for me to write....why?  Because I love this place, but last night the service was so bad I have to give it 2 Stars.\n\nThe Better Half and I enjoy going out to places that offer flights of wine.  We enjoy sampling different vineyards without the cost of paying for a full glass of wine.  Grape Street is our go to place for this.  Normally we dine at a table and enjoy a full meal with our flights.  However, last night we decided to go to the bar because we didn't plan to eat.  It was a mistake.\n\nThe bartender's service was horrible.  We had to get our own menus.  We each ordered a flight of the Zinfandels and glasses of water.  Once she poured the flights of wine, she didn't bother to tell us anything about the wine.  Normally, they will tell you which glass contains which wine and will give you a brief description of the taste & flavors.  She was more concerned with this guy who was sitting at the bar.  Keep in mind that there was only 5 people at the bar including my Wife & I when we arrived.  Within 20 minutes, there was only 3 of us remaining at the bar.....she spent all of her time chatting up the other customer.  Meanwhile, our glasses of water sat empty.\n\nI finished my flight before the Better Half finished hers.....that's always the case.  I was interested in having another glass and was considering one of the Cabs....however, she was nowhere to be found.  The bar was left unattended and who knows where she went.  Finally, she appeared with food for the other customer.  I waited until she delivered his order, then I flagged her down....she says \"Just one second\".....then she bolts from the bar.....what the ??  I watched her as she walked around the restaurant and she came back empty handed.....what was so freaking important that you couldn't take a drink order from a customer at the bar?  \n\nWhen she finally came over, I asked if I could sample one of the Cabs before I made my decision......she said \"sure\" and poured me a small sample of the Cab I requested.  Then, she walked away to do something else in the back.....didn't she want to know if I wanted to order a full glass?  Come on!  By this time, the Better Half said screw this.....let's go have a glass of wine somewhere else where we will be served.\n\nA server from the restaurant came to the bar, looked over at us and could see we were irritated....asked if we needed anything, I said Check Please.  She went in the back and found the bartender....who came over and said \"Didn't you want another glass of wine?\"......ha, not tonight and not with your crappy service.  I paid the check and we were on our way to another place.\n\nI didn't get the bartender's name, but she had dirty blond curly hair.....I remember who she is because when we come back, I will be sure to avoid the bar if she's working.\n\nThis place use to be so much better than this.  I don't know what's going on.\n\nWill I return?  Yes, but will only sit at the bar if she's not the bartender.  We'll sit in the dining area if necessary.",

I've heard so much about this place and for some reason have never eaten at one of there joints until the other day.\n\nAfter browsing the menu, I opted for a #5 Vito Italian Sandwich (Genoa Salami, Provolone, Capicola, Onion, Lettuce, Tomato & Italian Vinaigrette) and a bag of Jalapeno Chips & Soda.....another Soda Fountain got to me....they have Mello Yello Soda here....never tried it before, so I had to give it a shot.\n\nThe Sandwich was made really fast, they handed me the Sandwich while I was paying for the food....wow!  I anxiously unwrapped the Sandwich and was pleased to see a large Sandwich.  As soon as I took the first bite, I became an instant fan.  The Italian Bread was soft and was definitely the highlight of the Sandwich.  The Meats and toppings were very good too, but the Bread made this Sandwich special.  It was doughy and went well with the Meat, Italian Vinaigrette and Veggies.....it some ways it reminded me of the Subs/Grinders I've had on the East Coast.\n\nWill I return?  You can count on it!",

The Italian Club Sandwich has become my new favorite......it's full of flavor and filling.  I love the Hot Peppers....wish I could buy them at the store to take home.  The proportion of meat, cheese, and ingredients is perfect.  This is becoming one of my favorite Sandwich joints.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

    "text": "Stopped here as part of my Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition.  I live in the neighborhood, so it was only a matter of time before I gave it a try.  I was looking forward to have a couple of Slices of Pizza and was disappointed to find out they don't sell Pizza by the Slice.....Damn!\n\nI wasn't going to let that stop me though.....so I ordered a Personal Sausage Pizza \"well done\" and a 1/2 Hot Italian Hero (Salami, Mortadella, Ham, Melted Mozzarella, Lettuce, Tomato, Italian Dressing, $4.75).  It took about 15-20 minutes for the food to be prepared.  I went for the Hero first....it was served Hot and the Cheese was melted throughout the Sandwich.  What was odd was the Tomatoes and Lettuce looked like Salad thrown on the Sandwich....it looked out of place and promptly \"fell\" out of the Sandwich when I took the first bite.  It was very tasty, but I didn't like how the Italian Dressing was served on the side like a dipping Sauce.  Just a weird setup, but plenty of potential....3.5 Stars on the Sammy.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjHhb6lrJdOryY5Ao4pHOg?select=Iqzb-H48B0AgB0vX-tKhDg\n\nNext I went for the Pizza.....I took one bite and thought it might have been a bust....but it grew on me.  The Crust is chewy and the Tomato Sauce has an interesting flavor.....all I can say is that I wanted more and that's always a good thing....for now, I'll give it 3 Stars.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjHhb6lrJdOryY5Ao4pHOg?select=xHoP8sxg9hyWexhiY6x52A\n\nThe employees are really friendly too and I think it's family owned, which I love.  Overall, the joint gets 3 Stars and the Pizza will definitely get a 2nd try from me.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",

The Sandwich was piping hot....and looked so good!  I had to let it cool off for a minute because I didn't want to burn the hell out of my tongue.  It cooled off and I took a bite....WOW!  The combination of Baked Chicken, Ham, and Pepperoni was amazing!  The sharp flavor of the Pepporoni complimented the slightly salted Ham and perfectly baked Chicken Breast.  The Cheese and the Bread put it over the top!\n\nThe Fries were pre-fab crinkle Fries and were nothing special....I'll pass on them next time.\n\nOverall, I was impressed by their Sandwich.  I already love their Pizza.  I would give them 4.5 Stars if I could.\n\nWill I return?  There are a bunch of other Sandwiches I want to try....hell yeah!",

    "text": "I've passed this place at least 100x and have never stopped to check it out.  Today I stopped for some lunch.  As I pulled up to the restaurant, I noticed the sign in front of the joint that said \"2 Slices & Soda $5.95\".....perfect!\n\nI asked the guy at the counter if the 2 Slice Special is more or less Pizza than a Personal 10\" Pizza....he said the 2 Slice Special has more Pizza, so I went with it.  The special price is for Cheese only, to add more toppings it's $.50 ea, so I decided to add Pepperoni & Sausage to both slices.....total damage $6.95.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/SQ8Tkavc4TJj-2kanEDzLg?select=Z2zzt8zXaQBX8doxb9-58g\n\nI then grabbed a Soda out of the beverage cooler, they have Coke Zero, score!  I'm not much of a Soda drinker, but there are 4 Sodas I have a tough time saying no to.....Mexican Coke or Pepsi, Pepsi Max, and Coke Zero.  I swear they put liquid Crack in Coke Zero!\n\nAfter a short wait, my Pizza was ready.  The Crust is slightly thicker than a NY Style Pizza and you must fold the Pizza if you want to eat it properly, otherwise you'll have to use a knife and a fork....which is a Sin!  I took one bite and thought the Pizza was really good.  The Pepperoni was great, quality stuff.  The Sausage was pretty good, but not great......was missing \"something\".  The Pizza had the perfect proportion of ingredients.....the Cheese or Sauce didn't overwhelm the Pizza.....which is a common mistake at some Pizza joints.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/SQ8Tkavc4TJj-2kanEDzLg?select=wjkjIIETK87tO8549L0MaQ\n\nOverall, I thought it was really good Pizza.  I was left wanting more.....I could have easily eaten another 2 Slices......next time I'm ordering a Medium for myself...ha!\n\nI noticed their sign that said their Wings were Baked, not Fried.....heard from Matt S that it's some of the best Wings in town.....have to try that next time!\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

This year we changed locations because of logistics for people throughout the Valley.  \n\nI stopped in here for old time's sake on Saturday to watch a few games and enjoy a few Blue Moon's.  The place was busy but not too packed.  I wasn't very hungry, so I passed on food and just enjoyed my Blue Moon.  However, in the past I've enjoyed their Kobe Burger and Nachos.  Those 2 dishes stand out for me.\n\nThe service was great, as usual.  It's a very casual joint, so come here in your jersey and jeans to enjoy a few drinks and some grub.\n\nWill I return?  You can count on it!",

The Buffet attracted tons of people from all over the Vegas Valley and it was hopping every night.  That was when the Maloof's owned the joint.  \n\nFast forward 17 yrs later......now this place is a shell of it's former self.  I walked into this place a couple of weeks ago and it hasn't aged well.  The vibe it once had.....gone.  The excitement at the slots and table games....gone.  The happy employees.....gone.\n\nMy desire to return to this place.....gone.\n\nReturn Factor - 5%",

    "text": "Heard from @Dan P that they just tapped a batch of War Dog last Thursday....so I made sure I stopped by for lunch as soon as I came back to Vegas on Sunday.  Brought Mom's with me for our traditional Sunday lunch....we were staving and couldn't wait to get seated.  The Draft House is a Green Bay Packers Bar.....so it was packed with Packer Fans on the bar side....not one available seat or table.  It was 3 pm and the Packers vs Vikings game wasn't for another 2 hrs, but it was packed to the hilt!  We got seated in the dining room area, our server wes named Apple, seriously.\n\nAfter browsing the menu for a few minutes, we asked Apple if there were any specials....she proceeded to tell us about a bunch of Appetizer Specials ($2 off) and $2 off for the War Dog during the NFL Games, so we took her up on it.  We ordered:\n\n- 1/2 Order of Nachos $7.50\n- Bratwurst $3.50\n- Jalapeno Stuffed Pretzels $5\n- NFL Hot Wings (10 Wings) w/Chipotle Sauce....their hottest Wing Sauce $6\n\nTo wash it down, we both ordered Water and I of course ordered a 24 oz War Dog!  ($7.50, $5.50 with the special) The War Dog was freakin' awesome.....not as Hoppy as I expected based on @Dan P's report, but it was very good.\n\nAfter a short wait, we got our food....Nachos first.  Mom and I attacked those Nachos.  They were pretty good....topped with Sour Cream, Cheese, Guacamole, Olives, Jalapenos, Salsa, and Onions.\n\nNext up was the NFL Wings.....I jumped on those next....damn, they were awesome!  Very Meaty Wings.....the Chipotle Sauce was just right....had that Smoky flavor and was just Spicy enough for me and Mom.  The Ranch given to us for dipping went well with the Wings.\n\nThey brought out my Bratwurst next.....I added some Mustard and Relish and went to town on it.  It came with grilled Onions topped on the Bratwurst.  It was pretty good....although the Bun wasn't all that.  I would have preferred a Roll or Italian Bread instead of a Hot Dog Bun.\n\nThe last item to come out was the Jalapeno Stuffed Pretzels.....they were piping hot and moist and doughy.....delish!  They came with a side of Nacho Cheese for dipping.\n\nIt was at this point that Mom and I figured out that we ordered too much food.  I wasn't going to let this place defeat me though, so I pressed on.  Mom said she'd finish the Nachos and I would handle whatever was left of the Wings & Pretzels.\n\nWe took our time watching the Seahawks vs Cardinals game and finished our food and Beer.\n\nWhen Apple delivered our check she said she made a mistake and gave us the food specials for Monday Night Football, not Sunday....but that the restaurant was going to honor the specials anyway because of the mistake....is that great service or what?\n\nOverall, great food & great service.\n\nWill I return?  You bet!",

    "text": "I haven't been to Fatburger in a while and this was my 1st time to visit this location.  I'm a fan of Fatburger, but not this location.  Here's why.\n\nFOOD - 4 Stars\nI was prepared to give this place a 4 Star rating.  I noticed a new menu since my last visit to a Fatburger and ordered a XXL with all of the toppings & added Bacon & Cheese.  For a side, I ordered the Skinny Fries.\n\nAfter a 15 minute wait, I received my food.  To my surprise, the Burger was HUGE!  I should have paid more attention to the menu because this monster was more than I expected.....I guess I should have ordered a XL.\n\nI attacked the Burger and the Fatburger taste that I grew up with was still there.  The sharp flavor from the Mustard Relish and the Onions generated an explosion on my taste buds.  The Bacon was a nice addition and the Cheese was gooey and made it just right.  The Skinny Fries were just ok.\n\nOverall, the meal was awesome.....now, this is where it went from 4 Stars to 1 Star.....I went to the restroom to wash up since the Burger was pretty messy.  When I got to the restroom I was appalled at how disgusting it was.  It was worse than a Gas Station Bathroom.  The kicker was when I saw that the paper towels to wipe your hands were on top of the toilet.....what's the point of washing your hands when you're about to wipe it on towels that are contaminated from the toilet?!!!  \n\nSee the pics I uploaded for details....you'll notice the brown paper towels sitting on top of the toilet tank and that the spot on the wall where the dispenser is suppose to be mounted has spots where plaster was used to cover up the holes...the hand towels are almost touching the toilet seat!!!  ....someone must have pulled it off the wall....but they're not going to replace it?  My issue with this is that is the same bathroom where the employees wash their hands.....gross.  To be fair, I've sent an email to their corporate office to make them aware of this situation....it can't be up to code...can it?  I hope not.\n\nWill I return?  Not until they fix the issue with the hand towels.",

Here's my +/- breakdown:\n\n+ Large selection of food.  There's plenty of options.  They even have Pizza, although I don't recommend it....it's an Asian Buffet for Pete's sake!\n\n+ Decent service.  This place is always busy and they usually keep up with the pace.  Food is generally kept stocked on the food lines and the servers keep the glasses full.\n\n+ Food quality is OK for a buffet.  It's not great, but hell it's AYCE.....this isn't the Bellagio Buffet.\n\n+ Price.  The price use to be really good, but they've been steadily increasing prices over the past couple of years.....but still, $6.99 for a lunch buffet?!  That's pretty cheap in my book.\n\n- Parking.  Parking is a bitch when it's busy.....it's not the restaurant's fault though and my Star Rating doesn't reflect this....just saying, FYI.\n\nOverall, it's pretty good value.  If you don't like waiting, I suggest going in between meal periods when it's slower than peak times.\n\nReturn Factor - 75%",

We were disappointed to learn that some of our favorite dishes are no longer on the menu.  We loved the Crispy Asian Chicken Salad....gone.  What about the Salad Bar?  Gone.  Dammit.  Instead we settled on the following items:\n\nSliders, $10.99\nPotato Skins, $9.99\nBaby Back Ribs, $23.99\n\nThe Potato Skins were very good and so were the Sliders.  However, the Baby Back Ribs were terrible.  They were too dry and didn't \"slide\" off the bone like you'd expect them to.  Next time, we'll pass on those.\n\nOur server was very friendly and entertaining.  She also never rushed us.  Since we were meeting friends on this visit, we had a long dinner and stayed for drinks and Dessert much later than most diners.  She was super cool about it and stopped by to check in on us from time to time.\n\nToo bad about our deleted favorite menu items.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%",

Then, one day a colleague who lived in the neighborhood told me about a good Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood and I was like \"what? where?\".  Since that conversation, we've been here a few times and it's pretty good.  Here's what we've ordered:\n\nFour Corners Bean con Queso (Blend of Cheeses, Tomatoes, Leeks & Green Chili, Pinto Beans. Pico De Gallo & Sour Cream), $5.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-adobe-grille-scottsdale?select=bQp-AlHA8-NBSVc38Gouqw#bQp-AlHA8-NBSVc38Gouqw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-adobe-grille-scottsdale?select=F0fgEO8Du8oGMeal95NTCA#F0fgEO8Du8oGMeal95NTCA\n\nCheese Crisp, $5.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-adobe-grille-scottsdale?select=dLQdukiVyMb4LZHonyPmpw#dLQdukiVyMb4LZHonyPmpw\n\nChicado Melt (Fire Roasted Grilled Chicken with a Jack Cheese Melt, Avocado and Tomato Relish on a Potato Bun, Fries), $9.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-adobe-grille-scottsdale?select=PXiCT913Yc0-zZK1DPS0JQ#PXiCT913Yc0-zZK1DPS0JQ\n\nEnchanted Garden Enchiladas (Corn Tortillas filled with Saute\u00cced Mushrooms, Spinach, Zucchini, Corn, Onions, Cheese), $13.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-adobe-grille-scottsdale?select=g-ClybmxGE02-83Vf9RhyQ#g-ClybmxGE02-83Vf9RhyQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-adobe-grille-scottsdale?select=P2qf4BlV9ROaG7TOzxnboQ#P2qf4BlV9ROaG7TOzxnboQ\n\nChicken Chimichanga, $13.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-adobe-grille-scottsdale?select=NKZ61nuczbrIzqjTJ1qBGQ#NKZ61nuczbrIzqjTJ1qBGQ\n\nEverything is really good.  It's not your traditional Mexican food....the chef here is very creative with their menu items and the flavors are really unique despite using traditional ingredients.\n\nThe Bean con Queso is delish and addicting....good thing they don't give you too large of a portion, otherwise you could blow your appetite on the 1st appetizer!  LOL\n\nThe Enchanted Garden Enchiladas is an awesome Vegetarian option for the non-meat eaters.  I decided to give it a try one day just to be different....and it was really good.  I also didn't feel overly stuffed despite the large portion.\n\nThe Chicado Melt and Chicken Chimi are awesome as well.\n\nThe servers here are pleasant and friendly.  The vibe is pretty cool and great for a family night out.\n\nReturn Factor - 91%",

I saw that they had the typical Green & Red runny, mild Salsa and some Chunky Spicy Salsa...yes!  I like spicy, so I grabbed a few cups and filled them up.  Slight problem though...the cups for the Salsa were the soft, paper like cups typically used for Ketchup & Mustard.  You're probably wondering why that's a problem?  Well, it's because when you fill it up with Salsa, it becomes wet and soft and very difficult to carry in your hand because it spills all over the place....yep, it was very messy.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=g1dj4KmtgcSb0p46KFcaHA#g1dj4KmtgcSb0p46KFcaHA\n\nThe food came out a short while later and I started with the Carne Asada Taco....it is a pretty big portion for Street Tacos.  The portion size was the only positive though....the meat was bland....and the Guacamole and Pico de Gallo that was on the Taco didn't help much.\n\nNext was the Carnitas Taco.  This one had slight more flavor and was a little better than the Carne Asada....however, it was average at best.\n\nLast but not least was the Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito.  This was very good.  Some Mexican Joints like these have oily BRC Burritos...but not here.  There was no oil and the ingredients tasted fresh.  The Tortilla was very good as well.\n\nOverall, my experience here was average...3 Stars.  If I do come back, it would be strictly for the BRC Burrito.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%",

Because of it's location, this place is always busy when I pass by, otherwise I'd dine here more often.\n\nOverall, it's a great Burger and good vibe.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

It was a bit too much for me, so on subsequent visits, I ordered the Gyro Classic Sandwich.  The Gyros are ok, not great.\n\nMy favorite menu item here is the Vegetarian Combo.  It has all of my favorites on it.....Falafel, Hummus, Tabbouleh, yum!  However, I've had better in my life, which is why I'm only giving this joint 3 stars.\n\nThe service is so/so here.  One evening, we had awesome service....on a couple other visits, it wasn't very good.  I thank Groupon for introducing me to a new restaurant, but it isn't on my all time list.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%",

    "text": "Thanks to Groupon, we were able to find this place.  Located in Old Town just West of the Arts District, this Pizza joint is tucked away and kind of hard to find if you're not familiar with the area.  The signage is small and hard to read from the street.  Also, the parking here is atrocious....very few spots on the street and a tiny parking lot adjacent to the restaurant.  There's also a few lots across the street, but they belong to other businesses and you might get ticketed there....we took a chance and parked behind Prestige Cleaners across the street....there were no other spots avail, we had no choice.\n\nTo enter, you have to walk through a small section of their patio seating.  The indoor dining room is pretty small and tables are tight....I don't recommend for groups larger than 6 people...outside seating is better for that.  Since it was still blazing hot outside, we sat inside.\n\nAfter browsing the menu, we decided to order:\n\nAmericana Pizza (Pepperoni, Cheese), $15\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grazie-pizzeria-and-wine-bar-scottsdale?select=-DWyi7nRMAp5fjmTFIgJXw#-DWyi7nRMAp5fjmTFIgJXw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grazie-pizzeria-and-wine-bar-scottsdale?select=UfuwVsHtCTo_QLyHsPVbNQ#UfuwVsHtCTo_QLyHsPVbNQ\n\nComplimenti Alla Mamma Pizza (Ham, Salame, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Mozzarella), $16\n\nCaprese, $9\n\nRed Sangria\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grazie-pizzeria-and-wine-bar-scottsdale?select=LsEh4oNsfJCSplVJTsfriA#LsEh4oNsfJCSplVJTsfriA\n\nThe Caprese came out first and was very good.  The portion size can easily feed 2 people as an appetizer.\n\nBoth of the Pizzas we had were very good.  I thought the Alla Mamma Pizza was better than the Americana Pizza...but they were both excellent.  The Americana was a bit soggy for our tastes (too much Sauce)...but it was full of flavor.\n\nThe Sangria helped us wash it all down....it comes in a nice sized carafe....can easily satisfy 2 or 3 people.\n\nService here was pretty good too.

I poured some of the Hot Sauce that came with the Chips & Salsa on top of the Enchiladas to give them a nice kick....yum!\n\nThe service here was really good and they were very friendly.

    "text": "Based on the recommendations from a few local Yelpers, I decided to stop by this joint to have a few drinks.  The entrance to this bar/lounge is in the rear of the building....that was hilarious because I walked by at least 2 or 3 times hearing music and trying to figure out how the hell to get in, until I saw the sign that read \"Like All Good Speakeasys The Entrance Is Hidden In The Rear\"....ha!\n\nUpon entering the bar/lounge, I knew I would love this place....why?\n\n- It's dark....I love dark bars, hate it when there's too much light....that's the Vampire side of me coming out.\n\n- The bartender was very cool & knowledgable....when I asked him if he had an IPA on tap, he suggested the Bells Two Hearted Ale IPA and proceeded to tell me about the different flavors I could expect.  Then he stopped by to check and see if he was right and if not, I could get something else.....awesome.\n\n- They had a band playing, but I arrived after they just finished their set...so I don't know what they were playing.....but I love small live music joints.\n\n- The lounge area has plush sofas and chairs to hang out with your friends.  I wish I wasn't solo....it would have been nice to sit there with The Better Half and a few friends.\n\nWhat a great recommendation by fellow Yelpers from Scottsdale/Phoenix....thanks!\n\nWill I return?  You bet!",

    "text": "I've dined here twice and have been blown away each time.  The first visit was with a colleague at work.  He suggested that we drop by here for some Happy Hour drinks and some grub.  The 2nd time was with a large group of 20 people.  During both visits I had:\n\nQueso con Puerco, $9\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roaring-fork-scottsdale?select=bKnbIsW4l8RTkaS9V6WMdQ#bKnbIsW4l8RTkaS9V6WMdQ\n\nFresh Guacamole, $9\n\nKettle of Green Chile Pork, $10\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roaring-fork-scottsdale?select=4BV1eQ1pIjNl_31O18pXnw#4BV1eQ1pIjNl_31O18pXnw\n\nPork Wings (Dr. Pepper BBQ Sauce, Hominy, Pickled Vegetables, & Cotija Cheese), $12\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roaring-fork-scottsdale?select=7oUjMc9Y-to7ukr8hZF66A#7oUjMc9Y-to7ukr8hZF66A\n\nBig Ass Burger (Poblano Pepper, Cheddar, Smoked Pepper Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, Pickles, & French Fries), $14\n\nFilet Steak\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roaring-fork-scottsdale?select=SlhE1_wI2NJjRWSzL4CUtA#SlhE1_wI2NJjRWSzL4CUtA\n\nThe Queso con Puerco is melted Cheese with a green Chile Pork added to it.  It's ridiculously good.....and addicting!  Trust me, you won't stop eating it once you have a bite.\n\nThe Guacamole is awesome too.  However, I suggest that you give this a try before the Queso con Puerco so that you can taste the full flavor of the Guac.  If you eat the Queso first, the sharp flavors will override the creamy, smooth, subtle flavors of the Guac.  The Guac is outstanding and definitely a must have.\n\nThe Kettle of Green Chile Pork is pretty good.  It has similar flavors to the Queso, but without the Cheese.  It comes with Tortillas for dipping, wrapping, stuffing, etc.  \n\nThe Pork Wings were awesome and very interesting.  They look like a Chicken Wing at first glance, but then you realize it's a Pork Rib cooked/cut to look like a Wing, but much larger.  These are full of flavor and a must have.\n\nThe Big Ass Burger is big and sloppy.  The Poblano Pepper and Smoked Pepper Bacon flavors are prominent and offer a unique taste....which is very good.  Very difficult to take a bite of all layers at once...ha!\n\nThe Filet has a smokey flavor to it.  It was cooked perfectly and very satisfying.  \n\nThe service here is outstanding.  Despite being very busy during both visits, we had impeccable service.  Hats off to management and the staff.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

He was friendly, patient, and made sure the order was correct.  He also made recommendations to customers on the combo menu if it saved them money or if there was a similar items that they might be interested in.  He should be recognized for his effort as most fast food employees don't give a **** about their job or customers.\n\nMy food came out fast and accurate.  I ordered a 7 Layer Burrito and 2 Bean Burritos.  The only knock on it was that the Bean Burritos were messy.  When they wrapped them, they got red Sauce all over the outside of it...so the Sauce got on my hands.  Oh well, that happens sometimes during the busy lunch rush.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%",

Otherwise the Pizza bends down....\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5pMNyj77S1P3rrT69y1pkQ?select=obcx6HaVezeOz9Duw6_sTw\n\nI thought the Cheese Pizza slices were a solid 4 Stars.  They had a nice flavor to them and weren't greasy at all.  However, the Tomato Basil Pizza was not good....2 Stars at best.  The Tomatoes didn't have much flavor and tasted a little \"off\".....was not happy with that choice.\n\nTotal damage was around $8 and it included a bottle of Water.  Not bad for 3 Slices.  Next time, I order just Cheese slices.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%",

    "text": "Read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give this bar a try one night in Scottsdale.  It was one of a few that were open late on a mid-week night and looked appealing.  The restaurant/bar looks like it can be hopping on busy nights, but on this particular night (Wed), it was slow.\n\nI saddled up to the bar and asked for a menu.  I asked the bartender if they had any IPA's and he suggested the Odell brewing company IPA.  I went for it and asked him what he would recommend I try.  Since  it was considered 'late night', there was a special menu and he suggested the Pork Loin Sliders (3 Sliders with Pepper Jack, Poblano Serrano Mayonnaise, and Tortilla Encrusted Onion Rings).  It sounded awesome, so I went with it.\n\nThe IPA was really tasty and hit the spot.  After a few minutes, the Pork Loin Sliders came out.  I spread the Poblano Serrano Mayo on them and then for fun added some Fries on the Sliders.  I took a small bite out of the first Slider and it was awesome!  The Pork Loin was moist & juicy and the Poblano Serrano Mayo was the perfect compliment....adding a nice bite to the flavor.  I devoured the Sliders within a few minutes and then sat back and enjoyed the rest of my IPA.\n\nI really enjoyed this place and would like to return on my next trip to Scottsdale.",

We've dined in the restaurant area and the bar area.  If we want the full service treatment, we'll go in the restaurant....for quick eats, we go into the bar.  You can get the same menu at the bar as the restaurant, but not vice versa.\n\nWe've ordered the following:\n\nChopped Liver Platter (Sweet Bell Pepper Strips, Carrot Slaw, Onions, Chopped Egg, 4.95\n\nSpinach & Artichoke Dip, 9.95\n\nCheeseburger, $10.95\n\n12 oz Filet, $37.95\n\n1/2 & 1/2 Cole Slaw, $2.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/don-and-charlies-scottsdale?select=1Ci3JFh8BI-pWVnAOzTxxw#1Ci3JFh8BI-pWVnAOzTxxw\n\nOnion Strings, $4.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/don-and-charlies-scottsdale?select=abvoE3gWzuqV72x055JNug#abvoE3gWzuqV72x055JNug\n\nThe Filet & Cheeseburger are amazing and are my favorite.  I order one of these every visit.  The Better Half loves the Chopped Liver Platter....it's not for me though.  The Onion Strings are addictive...you've been warned.  I love how they offer a Cole Slaw side dish that's 1/2 Creamy and 1/2 Deli style....they're both good, but I give the nod to the Deli style if I had to choose only 1.\n\nThe service here is pretty good.  The only complaint that I have is that they never have any Ribs when we're here.  Our 1st trip, we came at 8:30 pm and the server told us that they were out of Ribs and that if we ever wanted to have them we'd have to come early like around 5:30 pm because they only order/prepare a limited amount....OK....so we came one day at 5:30 specifically to try the Ribs, guess what?  They were out already....WTF?!  Come on Don & Charlie....order enough to at least give us the opportunity to try this....I'm not going to play the game of come earlier next time.  That's the only bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended) about this joint.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",

    "text": "After a nice dinner at Carlsbad Tavern, I was in the mood to shoot pool....since they didn't have a pool table at Carlsbad Cavern, they suggested I drive down the street to Prankster's Too.\n\nI made the short trip and was pleased to find what I would describe as a Sports Bar style joint.  There were 2 pool tables and a full sized shuffleboard as well as some random video games and plenty of plasma TVs.  I was disappointed though to find nobody playing pool.\n\nSo, I saddled up to the bar and ordered a Beer and decided to wait and see if a game would start up.  After 20 minutes or so a few guys went over and started playing pool.  I went to the table next to them and was about to rack it up when a couple of guys stopped by and asked if I wanted to play a game of cutthroat.  I actually hate playing that game, but wanted to play and agreed.\n\nAfter a few minutes I realized that I was getting Hustled.....one guy was acting like the sucker and the other was the ringer.....this wasn't my 1st Rodeo and knew I was getting played....so I decided to play along and pull the rug out from under them.  \n\nAfter letting me win the 1st 2 games, I could sense that they were about to pounce and start making wagers on the games....I laughed and told them I was going home.  They were pissed and wanted to know why I was taking off....I told them that I don't play games for money with Hustlers and they laughed.  I told them I knew what was going on and pointed out what they were doing.  They both laughed and said \"Alright, you got us....\", then said....if you were that smart, then I was probably good enough to beat them straight up.  I told them....they will never know.  Then I left....ha!\n\nWill I return?  Hell yeah....next time with my sticks and will find those 2 for a real match.",

    "text": "Found this place via Living Social and have been here several times since.  It's a classic Spanish Tapas joint.  It gets busy on the weekends when they have live entertainment and Flamenco dancers on the stage.  When that happens, it can get loud and crowded in the lower seating area next to the stage.  We sat there once and didn't like it....it was uncomfortable and The Better Half and I couldn't have a conversation because it was too loud.  It's worth checking out at least once though.\n\nOver our visits, we've tried the following menu items:\n\nPan con Tomate, $9\n\nEmpanada Gallega, $9\n\nCroquetas, $11\n\nSpanish Sausage, $9\n\nPeppers & Goat Cheese, $12\n\nSpanish Fritatta, $8\n\nOut of the bunch, my favorites are the Peppers and Goat Cheese, Empanada, and the Spanish Sausage.  The others are just OK.\n\nThe service here is hit/miss and the Wine selection is not very good.  There are a lot of Spanish Wines on the menu, but they didn't taste good...I've sampled many of them and ended up disappointed every time.\n\nOverall, it's just an OK joint.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%",

Since I'm on my no Meat diet, I took her word for it....as much as I was tempted to give it a try, I resisted....maybe next time.\n\nTo wash it down, she had 2 glasses of Brazin Zinfandel $8 ea, I had 2 O'douls $4 ea.  All in, the dinner was $72 before tip.\n\nOverall, it was a nice dinner.  I finished my food, she took home 1/2 of her Pizza.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

The Chips tasted stale.  However, kudos to the CPK team on creating a yummy variation of Guacamole.  The Fried Mac n Cheese was awesome too.  The Mediterranean Foccacia was too hard for our tastes....we won't order it again.\n\nThe Sicilian Pizza is my fav...I always get it.  This location does a good job at delivering a tasty old favorite.  Of course, the Pepperoni is a classic and they do it well.\n\nFor dessert, the Belgian Chocolate Souffle is awesome...very rich.  I split it with The Better Half.\n\nService here is so/so....they have some young kids who you can tell it's their first serving job.  They're nice though, but need to learn the more refined aspects of customer service.....like making sure your Wine glass is never empty and offering dessert....we had to ask.\n\nReturn Factor - 70%",

The Chicken was amazing, so tasty and juicy!\n\nOverall, it was a great night.....good food and good times!\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

It was 6:30 pm on a Thursday and we were able to get seated immediately with no reservation.  After browsing the menu, we decided to order:\n\nBottle of 2011 Edge Cabernet, $50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=H0EVCkIUGi99mUMFWJhn-g#H0EVCkIUGi99mUMFWJhn-g\n\nIced Shellfish Platter, $36\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=hNpp4h_HpdQQeEItypxVsw#hNpp4h_HpdQQeEItypxVsw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=7A1cAyB1n_CGFibC94nO5Q#7A1cAyB1n_CGFibC94nO5Q\n\nWedge Salad, $14\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=ZLZ80iAimkaw6DvsKzP-3g#ZLZ80iAimkaw6DvsKzP-3g\n\nPepper Encrusted Filet, $44\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=gyhoMxTOhxyW0rpzv4tlAg#gyhoMxTOhxyW0rpzv4tlAg\n\nHudson Valley Foie Gras, $24\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=VBVpkMDbAofUXa9PBU5Cfw#VBVpkMDbAofUXa9PBU5Cfw\n\nIrish car bomb, $11\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=BTMQF5GK_IDSaphESOST8Q#BTMQF5GK_IDSaphESOST8Q\n\nS'mores $11\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=BIkjxuFzsIJUT4_TMQikkw#BIkjxuFzsIJUT4_TMQikkw\n\nLadgate 20 yr Tawny Port, $14\n\nFor starters, the Better Half had the Shellfish Platter and was very pleased with it.  It's not as large of a portion as it sounds, but it can be shared between 2 or 3 people.  I had the Wedge Salad, which was too sweet and \"soggy\" for my tastes.  As you can see in my photo, the Salad had dressing on the bottom of the Salad and was also topped with Pickled Onion, Tomato, and Avocado....it was missing that \"crisp crunch\" that I love about Wedges.  I won't order it again.\n\nFor the main course, TBH had the Foie Gras, which she devoured....she loved it.  I had the Pepper Encrusted Filet which was also awesome and cooked perfectly just a shade above Medium.  The Filet was full of flavor and the portion was just right.  To compliment our entree's we had a bottle of 2011 Edge Cabernet, which hit the spot.\n\nFor dessert, we had the Irish Car Bomb and the S'mores....the Irish Car Bomb was awesome.  The S'mores was good too, but very rich and we couldn't finish it.  They have a nice selection of after dinner drinks, so I had a glass of Ladgate 20 yr Tawny Port to go with dessert.\n\nThe wait staff is very attentive here and gave us impeccable service throughout dinner.  That's one of the reasons why we love this place.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

It's pretty dark up there and it's more quiet than downstairs, which was jam packed with people dining in, plus all of the people picking up orders.

    "text": "For my 1700th review, I'm writing about Razz's.  Thanks to Groupon, we've been able to enjoy Razz's Restaurant twice.  Located in an older shopping center on Shea & Scottsdale Rd, I recommend that you make advanced reservations and that you request a table away from the windows if it's during the hot months.  The reason is because the tables near the windows are very hot and the AC here is inadequate because it's an older building with inefficient insulation.\n\nNow, on to the food and drink....during our 2 visits, we ordered:\n\nParmesan Encrusted Pork Tenderloin, $25.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=_JHsWz6QExzzb0AA1EnFVA#_JHsWz6QExzzb0AA1EnFVA\n\nPeppered New York Strip, $32.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=oBcMb5p-hvyYty1cnUMV1A#oBcMb5p-hvyYty1cnUMV1A\n\nMixed Greens Salad, $10.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=dC5ZAKSQQZ9Elhvngs2iLg#dC5ZAKSQQZ9Elhvngs2iLg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=rPW_HwkpUZ5Bu4fRW6KLig#rPW_HwkpUZ5Bu4fRW6KLig\n\nPietra Santa Merlot, $48\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=hls4h8s8ve_f0F-V8ksaQA#hls4h8s8ve_f0F-V8ksaQA\n\nHahn Meritage, $60\n\nCrespelles, $14.95\n\nGrilled Rack of Lamb Chops, $38.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=W1f-8cJo9etFxHqTCa_9Pw#W1f-8cJo9etFxHqTCa_9Pw\n\nPan Roasted Duck Breast, $26.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=1HJTB9Obc8QtMtNrZwfz3A#1HJTB9Obc8QtMtNrZwfz3A\n\nPraline Hazelnut Torte, $8\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=6oN1CA-kP7F01Tl304S9ZQ#6oN1CA-kP7F01Tl304S9ZQ\n\nTriple Chocolate Torte. $8\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=72impFT4NM8YAheeriXDlA#72impFT4NM8YAheeriXDlA\n\nWhere do I begin?  Hmmm...well, the Mixed Green Salad is awesome. They have a house dressing that's to die for and goes well with the fresh vegetables.  A perfect way to start a meal.  I ordered on both visits, it's that good.\n\nThe Peppered NY Strip Steak was nothing to write home about....very average.  However, the Parmesan Encrusted Pork Tenderloin is A-W-E-S-O-M-E!  It has a perfect combination of sweet and meaty flavor to it....well done Razz, well done!  The Pan Roasted Duck Breast and Grilled Rack of Lamb Chops are also fantastic!  We enjoyed 3 out of the 4 entrees we had over the 2 dinners....great job team Razz!\n\nFor Dessert we had the Praline Hazelnut Torte and the Triple Chocolate Torte.  Both were very good.\n\nThe Wine we had on both nights was spectacular and went well with our dinner.  They offer a decent selection of Wine.\n\nThe restaurant also doubles as an art gallery, so you can find paintings on the walls for sale....if that's your gig.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=WoHdKk0R4Mip-GdlUe_Z2g#WoHdKk0R4Mip-GdlUe_Z2g\n\nWe didn't realize that the kitchen was actually right in front of the bar seats, so the bar seats are premium seats because you can watch Razz and the team cook...Razz will also come up and greet you if you're sitting at the bar.  However, since we didn't book reservations in advance, those seats were taken on both nights we visited.  If we come back, we'll try to book a couple of seats at the bar.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

Full of flavor and with just the right amount of Sauerkraut....yum!  The Sweet Potato Fries are good too....I could eat a whole plate of those!\n\nThe Mustard Pepper Cheeseburger was another interesting dish.....the Mustard gave the Burger a nice kick when combined with the Pepper.....the Cheese evened it out and the sweet, creamy flavor/texture of the Cole Slaw also complimented the dish.\n\nKudos to the Chef!\n\nThe bartender was really nice too.  He made sure I was good to go every visit.  I enjoyed watching the NBA playoffs here.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

What makes their Bruschetta unique is the tiny slivers of Proscuitto they mix in with the Capers, Onions, Garlic, Tomatoes, and Basi.  It gives it a slightly salty flavor that goes well with the sweet Tomatoes.  The Pizza dough they use is really soft/fluffy and in my opinion is very addictive.  The portion size of the Pizza is just right for one person with a big appetite, which is me.\n\nOverall, it's a nice place to have dinner.  We'll definitely be back.\n\nReturn Factor - 95%",

We were beginning to wonder if we had the right place.\n\nAfter browsing the menu, we decided to order:\n\nCaprese (Fresh Tomato & Mozzarella Appetizer) $10.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=hD15mxhKV-yWyU9iyYSFjg\n\nCarpaccio di Manzo (Arugula, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, Balsamic Vingarette) $11.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=BOaF8AVIQFJzYGdNXfqaVw\n\nGnocchi Ponte Vecchio (Potato Dumplings, Roasted Red Pepper Cream Sauce) $15.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=A0_HsEQNDFSbZinp4yoqkQ\n\nRavioli di Zucca (Butternut Squash Ravioli, Walnut Gorgonzola Cream Sauce) $17.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=3OI-0dzP0xwu1KNDKg7uEg\n\nAnd for dessert....\n\nTiramisu\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=AaXI7XufOAU0KVaXVoR7_g\n\nThe Gnocchi was amazing and the Carpaccio was awesome.  The Butternut Squash Ravioli was perfectly flavored and the sweet taste of the Squash went well with the sharp taste of the Gorgonzola Cream Sauce.\n\nOverall, it was a great meal.  What a hidden gem!  I hope they get more business so they don't close down.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

After browsing the menu, I decided to go with:\n\nSpinach & Artichoke Dip, $10\nBBQ Baby Back Ribs (w/Fries & Beans), $22\n\nThe Spinach & Artichoke Dip was pretty good.  We shared the dish between 4 people and it was enough for all of us.\n\nThe Baby Back Ribs were pretty good.  They fell right off the bone, just how I like them.  I wouldn't say they were the best I've ever had, but they were pretty good.\n\nThe service was very good as well.  The server realized that we were there to enjoy each other's company, so she didn't rush us.  She also made sure our glasses of Wine were never empty....a good way to stay on my good side!\n\nReturn Factor - 85%",

They have a new menu of premium Hot Dogs and they looked very tempting, so I grabbed my coupon and headed for this location.\n\nI decided to order:\n\nChicago Hot Dog\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Crz3YPKbXdRzftigOr62_w?select=aQgi3VN_Cj_GKf6BsuD8CA\nNew York Hot Dog\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Crz3YPKbXdRzftigOr62_w?select=3vkk0sdl_Fv-soALmxy0lg\nCheeseburger\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Crz3YPKbXdRzftigOr62_w?select=xefpZG1PaZqwR9msB56xiw\n\nSince I'm a big fan of Chicago Dogs, I went for the Chicago Hot Dog first.  Based on it's appearance, it looked promising.....except the Relish wasn't colored Car Coolant Green like the real Dogs in Chicago.  I took a bite and was pleased.....it was \"close\", very close to a real Chicago Dog.\n\nNext up was the New York Dog.  It was OK, not as good as the Chicago Dog.\n\nThe Burger was OK too......better than most fast food joints.\n\nThe one weird thing about this restaurant location is that if you decide to dine inside, you order through a phone and someone from the back brings it out to you.....strange, very strange.\n\nOverall, not a bad fast food option.  Will come back for the Dogs again.  Gave it 4 Stars.....was really rounding up from 3.5.\n\nReturn Factor - 77%",

The Burritos are pretty large and come with Chips...that was an unexpected bonus.  Before I jumped into the Burritos, I tried the Chips...they were stale, yuck.\n\nI then went for the Carne Asada Burrito....took one bite and was underwhelmed.  There was very little flavor to it.  Ok, another bite....and then another.  Wow, this was the blandest Carne Asada Burrito I've ever had.  Another unique thing was that the Burrito had grilled Onions and Salsa in it....very runny for a Burrito like this.  However, that didn't help with the flavor at all.  As a matter of fact, I only ate 1/2 of it.\n\nNext, I tried the Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito....again, it was underwhelming and bland.  I poured the spicy Salsa and Roasted Peppers Salsa on it to give it some flavor....that was it's only saving grace.\n\nOverall, it was a very disappointing dining experience.

The bar was packed, but we were able to comfortably enjoy our food and have a conversation.  The food was OK.  The Wine was the house Zinfandel, which was *eh*....but I didn't like the call options, so whatever.....now I know not to order Wine here.\n\nOverall, it wasn't too bad of an experience.

    "text": "I won a bid at silent auction for a $150 gift certificate to this place.  Located in Tempe and buried on the ASU Campus, this was not a restaurant that we'd normally stumble upon.  However, I am very happy that I bid on this even though I knew nothing about it...why?  Because the food here is fantastic!  Here's what we ordered:\n\nKorean Style Baby Back Ribs, $14\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=WDPYIOgCMIM-dJnKrKaMZA#WDPYIOgCMIM-dJnKrKaMZA\n\nYukon Gold Potato Gnocchi, King Mushroom, $23\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=2MsbjsZvu2hO1yeon7slaQ#2MsbjsZvu2hO1yeon7slaQ\n\nGrilled Filet w/Smoked Cheddar Bits, Asparagus, Cabernet Sauce, Crispy Onions, $36\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=LoIz5HIBcKYZcdOsoL2CAQ#LoIz5HIBcKYZcdOsoL2CAQ\n\nGrand Marnier Creme Brulee, $6.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=exAY1Qtwhzc2LmQNZZxjFQ#exAY1Qtwhzc2LmQNZZxjFQ\n\nDouble Chocolate Bacon Cake w/White Chocolate Butter Cream & Candied Bacon, $6.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=DquWbL5b-Xb625mfyM95SA#DquWbL5b-Xb625mfyM95SA\n\nThe Korean Style Baby Back Ribs were simply amazing!  The BBQ Sauce was sweet & tangy with just the right amount of Ginger.  Yum!\n\nAs everyone who knows me knows that I love Gnocchi....the Gnocchi here is delish.  The Grilled Filet was very good as well.  But the best part of dinner was the Dessert....\n\nThe Better Half had the Grand Marnier Creme Brulee, which I sampled and was very good.  However, the best of the best was the Double Chocolate Bacon Cake w/White Chocolate Butter Cream & Candied Bacon....yes, that's right Bacon lovers!  This Dessert delivers the goods on all levels.....it's Chocolatey, Sweet, and the Bacon adds a little salty/meaty goodness that causes your palette to jump for joy....my mouth is watering right now.\n\nThere were 3 things that kept me from giving this place 5 Stars:\n\n1 - Parking.  It sucks.  Jockeying for position against ASU student parking plus the customers for this place and area businesses is not fun.  They should offer a valet service up front just for customers....I'd pay $5-$10 just to avoid the nonsense.\n\n2 - Seating.  We were seated outside....not our preference, but the size of the interior of the restaurant is tiny and we were told the wait was long to sit inside.  They have a huge outdoor seating area with giant trees.  We were sat at a table for 2, the table was very small and the servers had trouble with space when we had a bottle of Wine, Appetizers, and Bread.  When then entrees came out, it was a circle jerk to rotate old plate off, etc.  The furniture is patio furniture and the pads of the seats are left out overnight, dusty.  There was a lot of bird shit on the wall next to where we were seated and fallen leaves all around us.....I was constantly worried about something dropping onto my food.  It was our decision to accept sitting outside, so it's on me.  If I come back, will definitely not sit outside, don't care how nice the weather is.  \n\n3 - Service.  It was so/so.  We had to flag our waiter down when we were ready to order Wine....a huge pet peeve of mine.  Also, had to flag him down to order our food and refill Wine and Water glasses.  I think the majority of the wait staff here are ASU students.....they look young and don't know how to provide proper service.  When we walked up, we didn't know where to go because the hostess stand is outside and isn't obvious....2 hostesses looked at us and didn't say \"Hi, how can we help you\" or anything at all.  It was only when we started to wander around the patio area that they said \"are you looking for someone?\"....LMAO, yes I'm trying to get seated in your restaurant!  Too bad because the food is outstanding.\n\nI will give it another try and see how it goes now that I know about the things to avoid.\n\nReturn Factor - 75%",

Although they are here frequently, it has been a couple of years since we've eaten at this restaurant.  I was in the mood for some Saimin so we headed down to meet them here for lunch.\n\nI ordered a small bowl of Saimin ($5.99) and a Teri-Burger ($6.99).  Their definition of \"small\" is Hawaiian Small.....which means H-U-G-E!  The bowl of Saimin was about a 1/2 gallon.  It was tasty as usual.  The Teri-Burger was very good too.....it comes with a side of Macaroni Salad....but I didn't try it, I was too stuffed.\n\nA couple of tips if you are going to visit this place:\n\n- It gets very crowded during Lunch and Dinner hours, so it's best to go between those meal periods.\n\n- It's a self service restaurant where you order at the counter and they either call your number or take it to your table.\n\n- You can order take out.\n\n- There is fresh iced water in jugs on the right side of the restaurant.....I didn't see this and ordered bottled Water.\n\nOverall, it was another good meal at Aloha Specialties....I got my Saimin fix for a while.\n\nWill I return?  You bet I will.",

It's dirty, smoky, and the people who hang out here are sketchy. We dropped in for a drink to check out the place on our last trip to Vegas and we could barely stay long enough to finish it.\n\nI have fond memories of the old Horseshoe.  It used to be the place to gamble downtown.  Now, it's become one of the worst places downtown.  Benny Binion has to be rolling over in his grave right now.\n\nReturn Factor - 2%",

It is not for the weak.\n\nMy favorite dishes are:\nQueso Fundido w/Chorizo - Basically a cheese appetizer with chorizo served on a hot fajita plate.  Comes with flour or corn tortillas....this is very good.  I order this when I take friends to this restaurant for the 1st time and every one of them agree with me.\n\nCarne Asada Burrito - Very tasty, good quality Carne Asada.\n\nInside their menu, they have a lot of dishes to choose from....not to mention an extensive combo menu where there are a lot of combo dishes.....I have tried at least 7 or 8 different combos...all are very good.\n\nWe go to this restaurant at least 1 to 2 times per month for lunch at work and 1 time per month for dinner.  The prices are very reasonable too.",

Although I've lived in Vegas for 17 years, I've never been to Ferraro's.\n\nA good friend was hosting a party there to celebrate the launch of his new company.  For hors d'oeuvre we were served slices of Cheese Pizza, Sausage Pizza, Risotto Balls, and Sausage w/Marinara Sauce.....all of them were awesome.\n\nOnce we were seated, we were served Gnocchi w/Marinara Sauce & Penne Pasta with Bolognese Sauce for Appetizers.  For a Salad we were served a salad w/Heirloom Tomatoes, Mozzarella, Balsamic Vinegar, Avocado, and Red Onion.....this was soooo good too!  For an Entree, I chose the Filet w/Wild Mushrooms in a Veal demi-glaze reduction while the Better Half chose the Fresh Seabass.....a couple of friends ordered Ferraro's World Famous Oso Buco......we loved them all!\n\nAnd to finish the dinner, we had Tiramisu & Cannolis....what!!!  I think I died and went to heaven!\n\nPlus the wine was free flowing all night long.....I can't remember how many glasses I put away.....ha!\n\nI hate to sound like such a Homer, but this was a really really good experience from beginning to end.\n\nWill I return?

    "text": "I heard about this place on Yelp Talk Vegas and thought I'd give it a try for lunch today.  It's located in an older, ethnic area of Vegas that has a large Hispanic population, so I thought I was on the right track.  I was excited as I pulled into the parking lot.  I couldn't wait to get inside and try it out.\n\nThe restaurant is small with about 4 tables for 16 people and counter seating for another 8-10 people.  It sounds like a lot, but it's crammed into a small area where chairs are back to back....very tight space.\n\nThe menu is pretty extensive, but I found it shocking that they don't have Burritos on the menu......WHAT??!!!  One of my favorite dishes and they don't have it.....oh well, I didn't give them a strike for that.  I saw that they had the bottled Mexican Orange Soda that I L-O-V-E, so I bought a bottle with the meal.\n\nI opted for an Asada Torta & a Cheese Quesadilla (it sounds redundant & I hate saying it, but that's what was on menu).....thought I'd try two items because I was hungry and I wanted to get a good feel for their food.\n\nThe tables have the standard Mexican Red & Green Salsa on the table for your convenience....homemade, which is a plus.  When the food came out, I was kind of disappointed with the size of the Torta, but it's about quality not quantity, so I won't dock them for that.  They also brought out a small bowl of pickled peppers, almost like Italian Giardiniera peppers....cool, I love those.  However, the Asada was very tough and bland....Strike 1.  It was pretty flavorless....so I had to add a lot of the pickled peppers & hot sauce to make it palatable....Strike 2.\n\nWhen they brought out the Quesadilla I was surprised to see that it was deep fried and looked like an Empanada (see pics).....looked better than it tasted though.  It too was bland!  Wow!  I couldn't believe it.....so again, I doused it with hot sauce and finished it because I was starving....Strike 3.\n\nI really really really wanted to like this place, but the food was just too bland.....I tried 2 items and it was a bust.  Damn, that's too bad.\n\nWill I come back?  I'm torn....maybe to try the Tacos and give them a chance for redemption.",

When I arrived, they were already seated and the Appetizers were coming out.  They ordered Coconut Shrimp (Crispy large Shrimp hand-breaded with sweet flaky Coconut & a Citrus-Mustard dipping Sauce) & Creole Baked Goat Cheese (In roasted Red Bell Peppers served with vine-ripened Tomato Salsa and Parmesan Toast).\n\nThe Coconut Shrimp was OK, not great.  They're large sized Shrimp.....the Coconut Breading was a bit sweet for my tastes.  The Creole Baked Goat Cheese was excellent!  If you try the Goat Cheese, you have to slice up the Bell Pepper and eat it....it was amazingly good.\n\nFor an entree, I ordered the Jerk Chicken Pasta (Jerk Chicken Breast, fresh Asparagus and Mushrooms tossed in a rich Parmesan-Herb Cream Sauce with Bow-Tie Pasta).  They weren't kidding when they said this dish was \"rich\".....I think I gained 5 lbs after eating this thing.....it was very good though.  Despite being rich, the Sauce didn't overwhelm the dish and it had a nice flavor.  The Jerk Chicken was cooked perfectly and was of good quality.....you could taste the flavor that Jerk Chicken is known for....I was left wanting more.  Thank God it wasn't bottomless, otherwise I'd have to buy new clothes afterwards....ha!\n\nOverall, it was good service and good food.  This place is a solid 4 Stars.\n\nReturn Factor - 82%",

    "text": "Located inside the Venetian shoppes on the 2nd floor, I saw the menu for this place and immediately made reservations for dinner.  We love Gnocchi and saw that they had several Gnocchi options on the menu.  We were seated in the large patio area and was able to people watch during our meal, which is always a lot of fun.\n\nAfter browsing the menu, we decided to order:\n\nQuattro Formaggi Gnocchi, $18.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/canaletto-las-vegas?select=cbg_W0iD07P2kHNcJKVVuQ#cbg_W0iD07P2kHNcJKVVuQ\n\nRisotto w/Truffles & Wild Mushroom, $25\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/canaletto-las-vegas?select=BWH4ejqydJE6CYBS-MRxag#BWH4ejqydJE6CYBS-MRxag\n\nChocolate Cake & Ice Cream\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/canaletto-las-vegas?select=D3pgjpm-GrEgrjaGAu1xqg#D3pgjpm-GrEgrjaGAu1xqg\n\nThe Risotto dish we ordered was not on the menu, but the server said they would custom build a dish for us if we had a request.  The Better Half loves Wild Mushrooms and Truffles, so she told the server and the chef put together this dish for her.  I had a few bites and it was awesome!  Sometimes all you have to do is ask.\n\nI had the Gnocchi and it was also very good.  They were soft and pillowy and a little al dente....there's a trick to cooking Gnocchi well and they have it down pat here.  The Cheesy and Creamy Sauce was perfect.\n\nFor dessert, we split a Chocolate Cake and Ice Cream....actually, I only had 1 bite.  TBH ate the rest of it....LOL.  It was very rich and sweet....perfect after a nice meal.\n\nOur server was awesome.....very attentive and willing to go the extra mile to ensure our dining experience was top notch.  I'll definitely be back.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

    "text": "A friend of mine hosted a dinner here during the G2E convention for his top clients and invited my Wife and I to join them.  When I heard it was at Hamada, I said \"We're In!\" and didn't even ask The Better Half what she thought about it....ha!\n\nA group of 16 of us were seated at back to back grills in the Teppan side of the restaurant.  We placed our drink order (glass of Cabernet) with the Mamasan and then enjoyed the company and conversation for what seemed to be a very long time before we were given our menu.  Not sure if it was slow service or if time stood still while we all chatted.\n\nIf you've never been to Hamada, the Teppan side of the restaurant is identical to Benihana.  A chef grills your order in front of the group of people seated at the table and puts on a show with the food.\n\nI decided to order the NY Steak & Chicken combo ($35).  The Better Half ordered the Two Lobster Tail dinner ($65).\n\nThe chef comes out and starts with the grilled Shrimp and Veggies.....then does the whole Volcano thing with the Onion.  Very entertaining, but predictable if you've been to Benihana.  I can't wait for someone to come up with a new act.  Then he gets into our entrees....I thought he did a great job cooking the Chicken and NY Steak.....both were cooked just right and had a lot of flavor.  I love dipping the Meats in the Sauces they provide for you.....although I have no clue what those Sauces are...ha!\n\nWe continued to eat and drink into the night and they made sure our glasses weren't empty.  A few of us did shots of Japanese Brandy and also had some Dessert, which was a Green Tea Ice Cream.\n\nOverall, it was a fun and delicious dinner with friends and colleagues.\n\nWill I return?  I prefer the other place, but will probably come back sometime in the future.",

It's too bad because I had some great times in here back in the early 90's.  Now, I wouldn't recommend anyone to stay here.\n\nWas here recently for a pool tournament.  The major pool leagues have their finals here every year.  It works great for the pool tournaments, but for the tourist/visitor, it's not a good property.  Stay somewhere else and play pool here during those events.\n\nReturn Factor - 0%",

It's near the Howard Hughes business area so there's always a ton of businessmen and women having lunch here on weekdays.  With this in mind, we decided to meet at 11:30 am (opening time) to beat the lunch rush.\n\nI went up to the chef and ordered a BBQ Beef Sandwich ($12), Cup of Chili ($5), and an Iced Tea ($3).  The BBQ Beef Sandwich was very good.  The Beef was juicy and the BBQ Sauce was slightly tangy and not too sweet....just the way I like it.  The one negative for me was the amount of Sauce, I would have preferred less Sauce.....you can't control the amount of Sauce though, it's served that way.\n\nThe Chili was amazing!  It is easily the best Chili I've ever had.  It's not for Vegetarians though.....there's Beef in the Chili.  The combination of ingredients was perfect....I wish I knew what was in it!  It also had a slight spicy kick to it too.\n\nThe atmosphere is upscale and professional, perfect for our lunch meeting.  Overall, it was a great experience.\n\nHint - If you want to try their amazing Prime Rib but don't want to pay the Dinner prices, come for lunch and get the Lunch Cut Prime Rib, which was $20 I believe.\n\nDid I get Value for my money?  Yes.\nWill I return?  Absolutely.",

    "text": "Solid place to take the family for some Pizza, grub, and fun.  When I lived around the corner from this place we would come here at least once every two months or so.  Since we moved a little further away, we don't frequent this place too often.  However, we were here recently when my Son and his friend wanted to grab some Pizza.\n\nWe ordered an Extra Large Pepperoni ($18.90).  The kids played in the games area while we waited for the Pizza.  After a short wait, the Pizza was ready.  It was as good as I remembered...yum!  Between the appetites of two 15 yr old boys and this Pizza Lover, we devoured that Pizza Pie in no time.\n\nOverall, it was a good time by all.\n\nReturn Factor - 92%",

    "text": "Had some time to kill, so I stopped in here to grab a bite to eat and watch the Cowboys vs Eagles Sunday night football game.  It has been over 5 yrs since I last visited this place and have heard a lot of good things about it, so I figured it was time.  I'm glad I did!\n\nThe waiter brought over the menu and as I turned through each page I got more and more excited......2 pages dedicated to Sliders, what?!!  I love Sliders!  Yes, it's true....two whole pages (see pics).  One page has exotic style sliders....ie Alligator, etc.  The other page has some unique ones.....I decided on getting a 6-pack ($15) which allows you to select 2 styles of Sliders.  I chose the Black and Blue (Black Angus w/Cajun Spices, Blue Cheese Crumbles, Caramelized Onions, & Chipotle Mayo)  and the Chicken Cordon Bleu (Grilled Chicken, Honey Baked Ham, Swiss Cheese & Honey Mustard Sauce).  However, I was extremely curious about the Ghost Sliders, which has Ghost Sauce, made from the world's hottest pepper....the Ghost Pepper.  Plus there's an entire 1/2 page on the menu dedicated to items prepared with Ghost Pepper!\n\nAs most of my friends know, I love spicy food.....but have never tried anything with Ghost Pepper before.  As a reference point, Habanero Peppers are 350,000 on the Scoville Scale, which measures spiceness.  Ghost Pepper registers 1,000,000+ on the Scoville Scale!\n\nI asked the waiter if I could have a side of the Ghost Sauce so I could try it out.  He said sure.....however, he didn't tell me I'd get charged an extra $1 for that....which kind of irks me.  Keep that in mind if you decide to order a side of it.\n\nTo wash it down, I had a Hardway IPA ($3)....that's right $3 for a 20 oz glass!\n\nAfter a few minutes the 6-pack of Sliders came out as well as the Ghost Sauce.  I wanted to try the Ghost Sauce before the food, so I took a toothpick and dipped the tip into the Sauce.....it burned the hell out of my tongue!  That is seriously H-O-T!  It's no joke!  But that's what I enjoy!\n\nSo....I took a Chicken Cordon Bleu Slider and dipped a little Ghost Sauce on it and took a bite.....yum!  It was great!  Perfect proportion of Ham & Chicken.....they complimented each other well.  The Bun was soft and fresh.....again, perfect.  Next I tried the Black and Bleu Slider.....it was just as good.  Although I could have had it without the Red Onion....I'm not a fan of grilled Red Onions...oh well, next time I get them without it.\n\nI'm glad I ordered the IPA because I needed it to put the 5 alarm fire out in my mouth.  I also ordered a glass of Blueberry Vanilla Wheat ($2) after I was done with the IPA....it was also very good and cheap!  Can't get over how cheap the Beer was!\n\nOverall, it was an awesome experience.  Good food, good Beer, and I lost my Ghost Pepper virginity!\n\nOther things worth mentioning.....there's a 7 lb Burger challenge, yes 7 LBS!  If you can eat it in less than 12 min and change, then you get it named after you.  Believe it or not, it's been done before.  No way I could do that!\n\nWill I return?  As the Macho Man Randy Savage would say......Oh Hell Ya!",

After browsing the menu for a while, I decided to go for the Steak Burrito w/Pinto Beans instead of Black Beans ($6.29) and a Carnitas Taco ($1.69).\n\nWhile I was waiting for my meal, I went to the Salsa Bar and filled up 4 cups of their spiciest Salsa.  The food came out relatively fast.  I decided to go for the Carnitas Taco first......it kind of like the \"Street Tacos\" found in Mexico.....Corn Tortilla, Meat, Onions, Cilantro, Lime Juice.  I poured some Salsa on it and took a bite.....it was pretty good, but not great.  It's very small and in my opinion not worth $1.69.\n\nNext, I went for the Steak Burrito which came with a side of Chips.....bonus!  I took one bite of the Burrito and became a fan.  The Steak reminds me of the Carne Asada I had in So Cal growing up.  The flavor of the Burrito hit home for me.  The Salsa was pretty spicy too, so that was awesome!  The Chips weren't that good though.....good thing I didn't pay extra for that.\n\nOverall, it was a good dining experience.  Glad I found a new quick Mexican joint.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",

There was so many to choose from and I was indecisive, so the waitress said she'd bring me a few samples so I could make up my mind....bonus.  \n\nAfter tasting a few brews, I went for the Fullers ESB.  It's a very good tasting English Ale that was very fulfilling.\n\nAlthough I've been here many times in the past, I learned something new.....you can't order hard liquor at the bar!  A friend of ours tried to order a Crown and Coke and they said that you had to be in the dining area and had to order food with a hard liquor order.  The reason is that their liquor license is for a Tavern, which means only Beer & Wine at the bar.....hard liquor in the dining room.  That sucked for the people in our group that didn't drink Beer or Wine.  I guess I never knew since I've only ordered Beer when I come here.\n\nOverall, it was a good time for everyone.  Will definitely be back again.",

    "text": "Oh Geri's....it's been way too long.  When I use to work on the Strip we would come here for lunch every other month or so.  Since I no longer work or live nearby, I haven't been here in a couple of years.  An old colleague of mine wanted to meet up for lunch and when he suggested Geri's I couldn't say no.\n\nSince it has been a while, I wanted to make this visit count....so I ordered:\n\nPhilly Cheesesteak Sandwich w/Cheese Whiz - $7.50\nPierogies - $3\nStuffed Jalapenos - $3.95\nSweet Potato Fries - $2.50\n\nI know, it sounds like a lot of food, but besides the Sandwich the portions are small. (see pics)  Plus, I was sharing with my friend.\n\nThey deliver the food as it becomes ready here.  First up to bat was the Jalapeno Poppers.  Stuffed with Cream Cheese, the Poppers were awesome....cooked just right so they weren't dripping with grease and the Cheese wasn't going to burn the hell out of my taste buds.\n\nNext up was the Sweet Potato Fries & Pierogies.  Again, cooked just right....not greasy at all.  I wonder how they do that?!  The Pierogies were very good....chewy, doughy shell with Potato filling....yum!  Sweet Potato Fries were great too....but I saved those to eat with the Steak Sandwich.\n\nLast up was the Steak Sandwich....one bite and I was back in Cheesesteak bliss....dammit Geri's, I've missed you!  I instantly remember why I love this place.  My buddy who was having lunch with me is from South Philly and he brings his parents here every time they visit from Philly (5-6 x per year)....it's a family tradition now, that's how good it is!\n\nNeedless to say, we didn't leave any food in our baskets.\n\nWill I return?  I'm not waiting 2 yrs for the next visit, for sure!",

    "text": "Was doing some Christmas Shopping with my Son and decided to stop by this joint based on the great reviews we saw on Yelp.  I've passed this place at least 100x and have never stopped to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.\n\nBetween the two of us, we ordered Wings w/Med Sauce ($10), Sliders w/Fries ($10), and Momma's BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger w/half Fries & half Onion Rings($10).  Our server Joanna, who was very nice, helped us select these items.  First up was the Wings.  They were pretty good.  Joanna recommended getting the Med Sauce for the flavor but having the Hot Sauce on the side for the heat.....it worked!  It was very good.\n\nMy Son had the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and it was huge!  He said he enjoyed it.  I tried some of his Onion Rings....they were thick, crunchy, Beer-battered, and soooo good!  The Onions had a nice sweet flavor to them that went well with the Beer-batter crust....pure awesome!\n\nMy Sliders were pretty good....I wouldn't say they were great, but good.  They were slightly overcooked....well done.  I think the cook took them off the grill Med-Well and then it got Well-Done between the kitchen and the table.  They had good flavor though and the Bread was really good...the best part of the dish.\n\nOverall, we had a great lunch and Joanna was especially helpful.  She has a great personality and made us feel welcome and special.\n\nWill we return?  We spotted a few other items on the menu we want to try, so next time we're in the area, we plan to come back.",

I finally had the opportunity to eat there yesterday and it was a big disappointment.\n\nWe arrived a little early and decided to have a Beer and much on some Chips & Salsa while waiting for a friend to arrive.  We also ordered a side of Guacamole to go with it.  The Chips & Salsa were ok and the Guacamole was ok.  The Chips didn't taste fresh and there was a bunch of mashed up small pieces at the bottom of the basket, which normally means we got an older batch and had the last basket before they prepared fresh chips.....Strike 1.\n\nWhen my friend finally arrived, it took forever for the server to come by and take our order.  At first we didn't realize how long it was because we had a couple of Beers to hold us over, but after a while we began to notice that it was taking a long time.  I had to flag her down after waiting for 15 minutes.....Strike 2.\n\nI ordered the Beef Fajitas & 1 of their Jalapeno & Cheese Tamales.  They are known for their Tamales, so I was excited to have an opportunity to try one.  The food came out pretty fast, but they didn't bring my Tamale and they didn't bring a friend's entree.  We waited for the food....they brought out my friend's entree, but forgot my Tamale.  I was too busy eating my Fajitas and didn't notice until I was 1/2 way through my food....I mentioned it to the waitress and she said she'd be right back with it.  Meanwhile, the Beef Fajitas were ok.....the flavor wasn't as robust as I would like them to be.....and the meat wasn't up to par.  It wasn't good quality steak in my opinion.\n\nEveryone finished their food and the conversation was so good that I forgot about my Tamale until my friend brought it to my attention.....damn, by that point I didn't even want it.  So I mentioned it to the waitress.....she apologized, but it didn't seem sincere.\n\nWe had a couple more Beers after lunch and when they brought the check, I saw the freakin' Tamale on the bill!  What the hell?!  Strike 3!\n\nAt that point, I didn't care anymore and since the Tamale was only $3 I paid the damn bill and we left.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed with the service and the food quality.\n\nWill I return?  Not a chance.",

When my Son was in Middle School, we'd have a weekly Father/Son Breakfast on Monday mornings....eat great food, read the WSJ, and talk about whatever.  Since he had today off of school, we decided to go this morning.  \n\nWe walked in and noticed a sign that said \"Ask About Our Gluten Free Menu\"....FYI for those of you that look for that menu.  The restaurant is casual and has indoor and outdoor seating.  There's counter seating too, if you're dining alone and feel more comfortable at a counter.\n\nI ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger Skillet (Ground Beef, Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, Seasoned Potatoes, 2 Eggs) $9.25 w/Sourdough Toast.  Kiddo ordered a Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs w/Sourdough Toast.....and Mom ordered the Turkey Sausage, Eggs, and Coffee Cake.....The Better Half (TBH) was the smart one and passed on Breakfast to go to her Pilates & Yoga classes while we consumed enough calories to start a Forest Fire.\n\nAfter a short wait our food was ready and brought out to the table.....it was just as I remembered.....big portions, and cooked just right. (see pics)  I had my Eggs over medium....they laid gently over the Bacon Cheeseburger and Seasoned Potatoes....I dove right in.  I'm a big fan of having the right proportion of food and they get it right here.....there's enough of each ingredient to be able to taste each flavor without overwhelming the taste buds with a single item.  The Eggs were made perfectly with the Yolk still runny but the whites cooked all the way through.  I added some Gringo Bandito Hot Sauce and devoured the entire dish!\n\nMom and Kiddo enjoyed their meal too....but needed a doggy bag to bring some of it home.  I wish I had their appetite....glad I hit the gym early this morning.\n\nAs usual, the service is great....friendly servers, kept our cup of Joe and glasses of Water full.  Another bonus is that they have a dining rewards club where you earn points for eating there and they send you offers in the mail for discounts off meals....we were redeeming a $8.00 coupon today....score!\n\nThis is hands down my favorite Breakfast spot in Vegas.\n\nWill I return?  You can count on it!",

    "text": "Took my Mom to breakfast on NYE morning.  It was 10:30 am and the place was packed!  We placed our name on the wait list and were seated after a short 10 minute wait.\n\nI was torn between the Short Stack Multi-grain Pancakes or the Raspberry Cream Cheese filled French Toast.  I decided on the Raspberry French Toast ($9.25).  Mom ordered a Hamburger ($7.35).\n\nAfter a short wait our food was ready.  I forgot how large the portions are....my Raspberry French Toast was enough to feed 2 people!  That's coming from a guy who can eat a lot! (see pics)\n\nThe French Toast was dusted with Powdered Sugar and had fresh Raspberries on top in addition to the Raspberry flavored Cream Cheese in the middle (see pics).  I put a little Syrup on the first bite.....yum!  It tasted sooo good!  As a matter of fact, I didn't need the Syrup because it tasted just fine without it.  I didn't use much Syrup for the rest of the dish.  There was so much food I couldn't finish my plate.\n\nMom enjoyed her Hamburger but thought her Seasoned Fries were too Salty.  I tried a few....they tasted good to me, but I could see how she felt they were too Salty.  I don't mind a lot of Salt.\n\nOverall it was another great meal @ the Cracked Egg.\n\nWill I return?  You bet!",

However, this particular day I wanted Mexican Food and was determined to try it out.\n\nI ordered a Carne Asada Burrito ($4.75) and an Al Pastor Taco ($2.40).  The restaurant is casual and has 15 or so tables, plenty of seating.  There's a small Salsa Bar (see pics) and a soda fountain.\n\nThe food came out after a short wait.   The Burrito was smoking hot....I could barely hold on to it, so I waited a few minutes while it cooled off a bit.  After cooling down a bit, I dove right in.  I was disappointed to discover that it's exactly like Roberto's Taco Shop.....damn.  The Carne Asada Burrito was just ok.....I think a bunch of Roberto's former employees must have went around town opening Taco Shops.  I don't think you would be able to distinguish between the two.\n\nThe Al Pastor Taco was a disappointment too.  It lacked the flavor that I expect from Al Pastor.....the smoky, marinated flavor.  It was bland.\n\nOverall, it was disappointing, but filling and OK.\n\nWill I return?  Probably not.",

Now, I only stop by when I take one of the cars in for servicing next door at Ted Wien auto service, which was the case during my most recent visit.\n\nIt's a nice place to hang out and have a few drinks while you kill time.  There are video poker machines on the bar, but since I don't gamble I hung out at one of the tables near the bar and surfed the web on my iPad.\n\nThe bartenders were very friendly and bored.....they'd talk to a rock if they could, so you should have some nice company too.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty cool neighborhood bar.  They serve food, but I wasn't hungry the day I was there, so no food this trip.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%",

If I was to rate this place just on the Tamales, I'd give them 4 Stars.  However, since they aren't, they only get 3 Stars.  Here's why:\n\n- Their Chips & Salsa is not that great.  The Chips are inconsistent....sometimes they're fresh and taste good, sometimes they're greasy and taste stale.  The Salsa is very weak and bland in my opinion.....no option for Spicy Salsa either.\n\n- Nachos and Beef Fajitas are my entrees of choice here.  Both are just OK, not great.  It fills my tummy, but it doesn't leave me wanting more.\n\nThe family enjoys coming here because it's close to home.  If it were up to me, I'd pass on it most days.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%",

Also had a bag of Jalapeno Chips and Bottled Water to go with the Sandwich.\n\nThe food came out a few minutes later and I dove right in.  As usual, it was a sloppy meal with stuff falling out of the Sandwich.  The ingredients were fresh and tasty.  For some reason, even though it's a Small Sandwich, it's always very filling.\n\nOver the years Capriotti's has declined somewhat.  It use to blow me away, now that it's been franchised I think their ingredients have lost some quality....can't support that with fact, only my opinion after eating at various Capriotti's for over 17 yrs.\n\nWill I return?  Probably, but won't crave it like I use to.",

It's casual fast food dining, so don't worry about dressing up.\n\nAfter browsing the menu, I decided to order the Gyro Time ($6.95) and the Falafel Pocket ($5.95) with a bottle of Water....total damage with tax $15.53, ouch!  This was without any sides.\n\nAfter a short wait my order was brought out by the cashier.  A small side of Hummus and Tzatziki Sauce.  I dove into the Gyro first.  It was full of Gyro Meat & Onions.  The Pita was nice and moist but the Meat was bland to me.  Despite putting the Tzatziki Sauce on it, it was still lacking flavor.  I was hungry, so I finished it.  Next up was the Falafel Pocket.  It was stuffed with Falafel, Tomatoes, Onions, and Cucumber.  I used the Hummus and remaining Tzatziki Sauce with the Falafel Pocket.  I liked it better than the Gyro.  The Falafel had a nice flavor to it and it went well with the toppings.\n\nOverall, I was underwhelmed by the experience and flavors of their food.

I wanted to try their Sicilian Pizza, but they didn't serve slices and I wasn't about to chow down that much Pizza....not that day anyway.\n\nThe Pizza is a NY Style Thin Crust.  It's served piping hot.  I went for the Cheese Slices first.  I thought that the Cheese to Sauce ratio was good.  The Crust was a little bland, but it wasn't soggy, which is a big plus.  Overall, I enjoyed the Cheese Slices.\n\nNext I went after the Pepperoni Slice.  I prefer to have my Pepperoni well done burnt a little on the edges, but I didn't hold that against them.  The Pepperoni has a nice zing to it and the Pizza slice had an appropriate amount of Pepperoni....I don't like it when too much Pepperoni is put on a Pizza, it can ruin the flavor.\n\nOverall, I thought the Pizza here was very good.  I'm not sure how it will hold up on delivery though as most NY Style Thin Crust Pizza that I've ordered delivered shows up soggy.  The people who work here are very friendly too, which is another plus in my book.\n\nWill I return?  Of course!",

One of my favorite dishes is the Dali Chicken, which is their spiciest Chicken dish.  When it came out, it looked dry and tough.....and it was.

I also don't like how they only give you a small bowl of Rice.....I have to ask for a 2nd bowl as soon as it's delivered to the table, otherwise I won't get my 2nd bowl before I'm done with my entree.\n\nOverall, it was a nice dinner with the fam.....everyone enjoyed their meal and although mine wasn't perfect, I wasn't going to let it ruin a nice night out.\n\nReturn Factor - 67%",

    "text": "Met some friends and colleagues for drinks and appetizers here last night.  It has been a couple of years since I was here....before the renovation.  I was anxious to see what it looked like.  The Better Half was here recently and said it was nice.  Happy Hour is from 4-7 pm and has $3 Beer, $5 on select glasses of Wine, and $8 Appetizers....normal Appetizers are anywhere from $11-$16, so $8 is a good deal.\n\nSince there were going to be around 10-12 of us, with some coming and going throughout the evening, we grabbed a table at the bar near the entrance.  The renovation was a success.  I like the new interior much better....it has a nicer feel to it.  The old design felt very stuffy and segregated the room into many sections.  They expanded the bar and made it larger.\n\nOne thing that hasn't changed though is that this place is not your typical bar in Las Vegas....it's targeting the higher end demographic.  What does that mean?  When I asked the server if they had any IPA's, she said \"No, and we don't have any Beer on tap\".....I said \"What?!  Seriously?!\"....she said \"We're not THAT kind of bar\".....ha ha!  I forgot how pretentious this place was....no big deal, I should have remembered.  So consider yourself warned.....\n\nThat ended up becoming the joke of the night.  I told the rest of our group about the exchange with the server so we told everyone who arrived to ask the server \"Where's the Beer Pong table?\" or \"Do you have a Golden Tee here?\"....ha ha!  The server thought it was funny.\n\nBack to the experience....we ordered several appetizers.....Oysters, Sliders, Chicken Satay, and Calamari.  Since I don't eat Seafood, I only tried the Sliders and Chicken Satay.  The Sliders were Angus Beef with Grilled Onions & Cheese....very tasty.  The bun was moist & chewy, went well with the Beef.  The Chicken Satay had a nice tangy flavor to it....very delicious.  The rest of the group who tried the Seafood said it was good.\n\nWe hung out at Sedona for 4 hours or so....we all had a blast.\n\nWill I return?  You bet!",

I intended to order 2 Slices of Pizza....but after reviewing the menu, I couldn't help myself and ordered a NY Hot Dog (Dog, Fries, Green Peppers, Onions, Parmesan Cheese, Italian Roll) and a Slice of Sausage Pizza.\n\nThe Sausage Pizza Slice came out first.....it was loaded with Sausage....too much in my opinion (see pics).  I also thought the Cheese to Sauce ratio was off.....not enough sauce, the Pizza tasted dry.  The Crust was good and cooked well.....if I was rating just on the Pizza, this place would get 2 or 3 Stars.\n\nThe NY Hot Dog on the other hand was Fantastic!  The all beef dog was juicy & full of flavor.  The combination of the Fries, Green Peppers, and Onions made the sandwich taste a little like Breakfast.  It was soooo good!  I could have eaten 2 of them!  This NY Hot Dog is what bumped this place to 4 Stars for me since I've never seen this item anywhere else.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience here.  There are other items on the extensive menu that I want to try.\n\nWill I return?  Fah-getta-bout It, of course!  Probably not for the Pizza though.....ironic.",

    "text": "After living in the Phoenix area for 3 yrs, we finally had the opportunity to try the legendary Pizzeria Bianco.  We heard all of the horror stories of 2 to 3 hr long waits and to grab yourself a Bottle of Wine and prepare for a long night out....we didn't care and went out on a Monday night to give it a try.  To our surprise, there was NO WAIT at all, YEAH!!!!\n\nWe were immediately seated at a table (2 top) and given our menus.  It's very dark in the dining room and the menus were a little difficult to read in the ambient light....had to use our cell phone flashlight.  We decided to order:\n\nSonny Boy w/Sausage \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pizzeria-bianco-phoenix?select=MyRRg57xLO58zg7bbf2fcg#MyRRg57xLO58zg7bbf2fcg\n\nBianco Verde w/Prosciutto\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pizzeria-bianco-phoenix?select=39b-Ufs5AEg-UJiR9u5qRg#39b-Ufs5AEg-UJiR9u5qRg\n\nWhile we were waiting for our food they sat a table of 5 at the 4 top next to us....since the tables are so close, the back of the 5th person's chair was nearly touching our table...that kind of crept into our personal space and was a little uncomfortable.....especially since one of the girls in his party looked at us while getting seated and proclaimed \"It's his birthday, woo-hoo!!!\".....that's awesome and I hope you guys have a good time, but we came here to dine by ourselves and enjoy each other's company, not join a strangers birthday party....*ugh*...\n\nOur Pizza came out a short time later.  I had the Sonny Boy w/Sausage added.  I took one bite and instantly became a fan of their Pizza.  It was cooked perfectly with a nice thin crust.  The dough wasn't chewy or undercooked....it was just right.  The Sausage had good flavor and the Pepperoni didn't overwhelm the Pizza.\n\nThe Better Half had the Bianco Verde w/Prosciutto.  When it came out, it was covered in Greens....LOL, it looked pretty hilarious as I've never seen a Pizza that looked like this before.  It tasted pretty good though.  I had a slice and thought it would suck because of all of the greens on it....it's not something I would personally order, but my Wife enjoyed it and said she'd order it again.\n\nThe service here was pretty good.  The server was pleasant, friendly, and attentive.  I'm not sure the Pizza is worth a 2 or 3 hr wait, but it's pretty good.  We'd come back on another slow night.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",

You park in the back of the restaurant and walk in through the kitchen, how cool is that?!  Before I took a bite of food, I was a fan of this place.  After my first meal, it went to the top of my list.  \n\nSince that first visit, I've been back several times for lunch and dinner.  It never disappoints.  Some items I've had here:\n\nWedge Salad w/Gorgonzola\nBeefsteak Tomato Salad w/Bleu Cheese Crumbles\nFrench Dip\n12 oz Filet\nChop House Burger w/Cheese\nSide of Rice Pilaf\n\nFor lunch, my 2 fav items are the French Dip and the Chop House Burger w/Cheese.  They're very good and fill you up nice.\n\nFor Dinner, I always get the Filet.  It's my favorite cut of Beef and Durant's does a great job with their Filet.  I like to have it with a side of Rice Pilaf....yum!\n\nThe Salads here are pretty big, so I recommend splitting them.

What that translates to is low prices on food & drink and a packed house...good times indeed.\n\nSome of the items I've had during my visits...(Happy Hour Pricing)\nEdamame, $3\nCoconut Chicken Skewers, $5\nKobe Sliders, $8\nCrispy Chicken Spring Rolls, $8\nBoneless Chicken Wings, $6\nRavenswood Vinter's Blend Zinfandel, $7\n\nAll of the food is delicious.  My favorites are the Kobe Sliders & Boneless Chicken Wings.  The other food is grub too, but these two are my fav's.\n\nThe bar area is a meat market and if you get a booth or table that has a view of the bar, it's great for people watching...LOL\n\nFinding a table during peak dinner hours 5-7 pm can be a challenge if you don't have reservations, so I recommend calling in advance.  There are also Teppanaki tables available, if that's your preference....we've never dined there but can see the show from our booth....it looks similar to Benihana.\n\nOverall, it's a fun place to grab some grub and drinks.\n\nReturn Factor - 93%",

It's one of the few places outside of Old Town Scottsdale that stays open late every night of the week.....yes, you can find this place open after 10 pm ANY night of the week!  If you're like me and need to find action and energy, this is the place.\n\nI've already covered the happy hour pricing and some of the food we've had here in my prior review...that is still the case....we love happy hour here.  It's still a meat market and is fun to watch when it gets busy.  A lot of professional baseball and football players hang out here, so there are a lot of groupie wannabe girls that hang out trying to land one of those athletes....they're especially fun to watch trying to get the athletes' attention...LOL\n\nSince my last review, I've had the BBQ Pork Tacos and they've become one of my fav dishes....add it to the list on the prior review.  These Tacos have a unique flavor and taste.  Instead of a hard corn shell like regular Tacos, they use a crispy Rice shell....and they use a sweet & sour sauce instead of Taco sauce....combine that with the BBQ Pulled Pork and pickled Vegetables....hmmm...so good!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sapporo-scottsdale?select=gFeRmjpDXp9DsOd2a0uM1g#gFeRmjpDXp9DsOd2a0uM1g\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sapporo-scottsdale?select=QrtOYowxYl5zJMrna6tPlg#QrtOYowxYl5zJMrna6tPlg\n\nYou can find us here at least once a month or more.  One of these days, we will dine at the Teppanyaki tables....but we've seen that kind of cooking many times before, so we're not really motivated to.  We'll keep coming back though.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

After browsing the menu, I decided to order off the lunch special menu where you can select a salad, appetizer, and entree for $12.95 or $14.95 depending on the entree selection.  I ordered:\n\nPickled Cucumber Salad\nPork Potstickers\nOrange Chicken\nFried Rice\n\nMy order totaled $12.95 for those selections, which is a pretty good deal considering the amount of food you get.\n\nThe Pickled Cucumber Salad was pretty good....it's very sweet and has a little sour flavor to it.  A nice start for lunch.\n\nThe Pork Potstickers were just OK.  They were kind of hard on the edges, which means they were left out under a heat lamp too long.\n\nThe Orange Chicken was OK....very sweet.  The Fried Rice was very good....it helped to lessen the sweetness of the Orange Chicken, so it complimented it very well.\n\nOverall, it was an average lunch.  I'd consider coming back again.\n\nReturn Factor - 70%",

    "text": "Awesome place to grab a business lunch.  It's tucked away in the Scottsdale Mall near Drinkwater.  In my opinion, the best place to park is the parking garage next to the mall area.  The interior has a modern design and you just feel cool dining here.  For lunch, I like to order:\n\nDipping Fries, $6\n\nCheeseburger, $10.25\n\nThey're 2 very solid choices.  The Cheeseburger is big and fills you up.  It's also very tasty.  The Dipping Fries are delish....I only get them when I'm super hungry or if someone else is willing to split it with me, otherwise I will go back to the office with a serious case of carb coma.\n\nThe service here is awesome.  If you're here on business, the servers give you space and make sure they don't interrupt too much, but at the same time ensure that you're drink glasses are kept full.\n\nI highly recommend.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

I could eat it all day long.\n\nThe Toasted Ravioli and Bruschetta are good, not the best, but above average.  The Thin Crust Pizza is my fav though.  We order it \"well done\" so it comes out crispy and the Cheese has a slight burn on top.  They do it right here....soooo good!\n\nI was convinced by a co-worker to try the Mini Stuffed Pizza one day....it was good, but I could only have 1 slice, it was too filling.\n\nThe servers here are great and easily handle the 25 of us and our quirkiness.\n\nReturn Factor - 88%",

The hostess told us it would be 1.5 to 2 hrs....wow!  We could get seated right away if we sat outside....but it was raining off/on, so we'd have to take a chance.  I walked outside and they have umbrellas, so we took a chance and chose to get seated immediately.\n\nLuckily for us it didn't rain while we dined...ha!  I ordered:\n\nFilet Mignon Merlot - (w/Butter, Red Wine Reduction) $34.95\nMacaroni Gratin - $6.95\n\n....to wash it down, we ordered a bottle of Malbec for $58.\n\nWhile we waited for our food, it rained a little bit.  However, with the umbrellas and patio space heaters, we were comfortable and dry.  It was actually kind of cool to sit outside on the Las Vegas Strip and watch the clouds pass overhead and rain on the city.  In the 20+ yrs I lived in Vegas, I never had an experience like that.  Having Wine during the rainfall was even better.\n\nThe food came out after a while and my Filet was cooked perfectly.  I ordered it Medium-Well with just a little \"pink\".  The Red Wine Reduction was heavenly and smooth on the palate.  The Mac Gratin was rich and complimented the Filet very well.\n\nOverall, it was an awesome dining experience.  Don't know if I can replicate the ambiance and scenario.  The waiter was super cool and handled the weather/packed restaurant situation very well.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

One of the highlights of the property is the fireside lounge, which features an open fire pit that people can hang around.  The bright purple & blue neon flashes you back to the hey day of Vegas.\n\nFood - They offer a wide variety of dishes from Breakfast to Dinner.  Since I started working very close to the Peppermill, I will be here often for lunch.  Today I decided to give the Chicken Pesto sandwich a try.  It was very tasty and the serving was huge.  A nice sized portion of fries comes with the dish.\n\nService - Most of the time, they are very busy and you'll have to wait a little while for a table.  However, they crank out the orders and you get served in decent time.  It's hit or miss though as sometime you'll wait a while if they're really slammed.\n\nI gave this place 4 Stars because I've been a fan of it since I moved here in '93.  I will always return as long as they keep their atmosphere, food, and service the same.  Almost gave it 5 Stars, but the only thing that held me back was the hit or miss on the service levels.",

It was a business breakfast, so she allowed us private time to handle business and when we were ready for food, she came by to take our order.\n\nI ordered the Belgian Waffles this morning.  The waffle was very good....not under/over cooked like I experience at some restaurants.\n\nMy favorite part about this place is that it's a throwback....not only in decor, but in service.  Everyone there is friendly and works hard to ensure your meal goes well.\n\nWill I return?  You bet!",

    "text": "Had a few friends visiting from out of town this weekend, so we decided to get together for dinner here.  The Better Half & I have been here once back in July 2007.  We didn't really care for it then, but decided to give it another shot.\n\nI ordered the Filet & she ordered the Salmon.  The table split a bunch of side dishes; Fries, Creamy Potatoes, Spinach, Mushroom & Peas Risotto, Asparagus, Potatoes Au Gratin.  My Filet was cooked to my liking, but it was underwhelming.  The flavor was good, but it was missing \"something\"....it didn't make me want more.  Wifey enjoyed her Salmon, but said it wasn't great.  The sides were underwhelming too....the Potatoes Au Gratin were very runny, the highlight was the Fries.\n\nI split a Buffalo Mozzarella Salad with a friend of mine for an Appetizer & it was too soft & runny for my tastes.\n\nThe best part about dinner was the wine.  We had a Magnum of 2005 Faust Cabernet Sauvignon, which was excellent!  It had a nice bold flavor and had hints of Blackberry & a slight peppery taste to it.  It went well with the steak.\n\nOverall, the experience was underwhelming.  Certainly not worth the $355 for Wifey & I.  We've had much better dinners for much less.\n\nWill we return?  Unless someone else pays for it, probably not.",

There was a concert (George Clinton) in the theater, so parking was tough and we didn't get to the buffet until 7 PM.\n\nEven though I was completely stuffed from the 6 prior buffets, I somehow found the room to go for a final plate.  This buffet is one of the largest of the 7 and offers Mediterranean fare, which is unique to the other buffets. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Fi-2ruy5x600SX4avnrFuA?select=vV2f1x98dos-4W17IMuQBA \n\nI decided to have some Chinese food, Pizza, and Penne Pasta.....had to stick with my No Meat diet and these were the most appetizing items I found.

If I had more room, I'd go for some of the Mediterranean items.....the other Yelpers who tried it said it was pretty good.  I'll take their word for it.\n\nOur server was friendly and kept our glasses full.  We were seated in the middle of the buffet so we had easy access to the entire line of food.  Good stuff.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

Kind of difficult to find parking nearby, but once we got in, it was a lot of fun.\n\nWe were lucky enough to find an open pool table in the back, so we grabbed it and watched the band and people on the dance floor.  After shooting a few games of pool, we ordered some Nachos and a Quesadilla.  The food was OK, nothing great.  Service was kind of slow....our Beers were empty a lot.\n\nDespite it's shortfalls, it is still a decent place to be entertained.\n\nReturn Factor - 77%",

We opted to dine on the 2nd floor and listen to the entertainer....he was a one man show playing a keyboard and singing jazz tunes...he was ok.\n\nAfter browsing the menu, we opted for:\n\nWedge Salad, $8\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobbys-restaurant-and-jazz-lounge-scottsdale-2?select=RE9cSGRSgIMWiINEvBDuyw#RE9cSGRSgIMWiINEvBDuyw\n\nEscargot, $12.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobbys-restaurant-and-jazz-lounge-scottsdale-2?select=exaKPAULLoKK3UiMswa45g#exaKPAULLoKK3UiMswa45g\n\nGnocchi & Veal Meatballs, $19.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobbys-restaurant-and-jazz-lounge-scottsdale-2?select=jEw_PDJRRRaxT87FNMBGIg#jEw_PDJRRRaxT87FNMBGIg\n\nDuckling (Half Bone-In, Wild Rice, Vegetables), $25.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobbys-restaurant-and-jazz-lounge-scottsdale-2?select=rJOCFs1iVgbyUMSgQBpdeA#rJOCFs1iVgbyUMSgQBpdeA\n\nTiramisu\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobbys-restaurant-and-jazz-lounge-scottsdale-2?select=Gvhvnst10z0y1-UeO22Ntg#Gvhvnst10z0y1-UeO22Ntg\n\nAlmond Cake\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobbys-restaurant-and-jazz-lounge-scottsdale-2?select=5xbnXGSOc6Ly-rnw7rRV1Q#5xbnXGSOc6Ly-rnw7rRV1Q\n\nI love Wedge Salad....and they do it well here...it was very good.  The Wife had the Escargot and loved it....I'm not a fan.  She had the Duckling and also loved it....I had a bite and it was moist and full of flavor.  My dish was the Gnocchi w/Veal Meatballs....that dish was ridiculously good.  The Sauce was rich and creamy and the Veal Meatballs were awesome.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered Tiramisu and Almond Cake....we didn't need the calories, but it was worth it....they were both good.  Of course we downed a bottle of Wine with dinner and a glass of Port with dessert.  Service was excellent throughout dinner.\n\nWe'd love to come back....just hoping they can overcome their bad location.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

    "text": "Buffet of Buffets Marathon - Stop #5 of 7 3:00 PM\n\nAfter 4 buffets in the past 5 hours, there was a part of me that wanted to quit at this point and just drive home.  Realizing how stupid that would be, I decided to press on and head over to the Rio for Stop #5 on the Buffet of Buffets Marathon.\n\nOnce again, when our group was seated we took a few minutes to pause and gain the strength to go after another round of food.\n\nThis buffet is one of the largest out of the 7 on the list and there was plenty to choose from.  Since I'm not eating Meat right now, I narrowed down my choice to a Cheese Enchilada, Chimichanga, Slice of Pizza, Quesadilla, and a Churro.  All were very, very good.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw?select=fQjaJZ3bmRecEo0iZHEebQ\n\nIf I had any more room in my stomach, I would have sampled more dishes, but I just couldn't muster the strength.  Here are some samples of what was available:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw?select=9MYQJhB3J2xaVciDcqzodw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw?select=TNoxBrLpe1HUqOCO6WdiWg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw?select=GmIOlUaUWPeK3QDpaZeIog\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw?select=dAElVFwveZIns7Jt_3FhyQ\n\nOverall, the service was the best here.  Our server brought us out some Champagne and was quick with the refills and clearing of the table.  The food selection here is awesome too.....as well as the quality.  A 5 Star buffet for sure.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

The Green Chile Burger was awesome.  The bitter taste of the Peppers went well with the juicy Burger and melted Cheese....also, the Chipotle Aoli gave it a smooth finish and nice kick.\n\nService here was very good.

However, once we got inside, I changed my mind.  There were a lot of great items to choose from....but I decided to get the Cheese Raviolis & Dessert.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZkGDCVKSdf8m76cnnalL-A?select=e0zI2pyLCY5XNPjU5w-57Q\n\nThe Cheese Raviolis were very good and the Dessert was awesome.  The highlight for me was the Creme Brulee....made fresh and torched brown.  Nice show by the workers.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZkGDCVKSdf8m76cnnalL-A?select=-BGJIFFwJT1ZU91d3VDbzg\n\nOverall, it was a good time and good food.  Too bad I had very little room left to sample more items.\n\nReturn Factor - 85%",

    "text": "I was at the Mirage today for a trade show and decided to finally give this joint a try.  I should have known better when I saw that you had to be seated by a hostess.....what Deli seats you with a hostess?  Seriously?\n\nAnyway, I asked to be seated and she sat me at a two top table that had place settings, but the table was still dirty with small pieces of pickle on the table....gross.\n\nAfter browsing the menu, I almost left.  The prices were ridiculous!  I decided to stick it out and be a trooper and give the place a chance.  I ordered a $15.99 Hot Pastrami Sandwich on Rye Bread.....that's right folks.....that's not a typo....$15.99 for a Hot Pastrami Sandwich and it doesn't come with Chips or Fries.....FREE pickles though, which tasted pretty good.\n\nTo wash it down, I ordered an Iced Tea and Water.....the server didn't leave me any straws (I hate that by the way).....yet every other table around me had straws.....and I watched....nobody asked for them, they were just given to them by their server.  Maybe my server was having an off day....I don't know.\n\nThe food came out pretty fast.  The Pastrami Sandwich is your typical New York Style.......5 inches of meat that's impossible to put in your mouth.  Since my name isn't Joey Chestnut (Google him), I took a fork and pulled 20% of it out so that I could eat it like a normal person.\n\nBesides the complimentary Pickles that were awesome, the other thing that saved this joint from a 1 Star was the Deli Mustard on the table.....man was it awesome!  I doused each bit with this Mustard....which made the sandwich edible because the Pastrami was dried out and too chewy.  Also, the crust of the Rye Bread was tough....had a Beef Jerky texture to it.....what?  I've never had Rye Bread like that......maybe it's normal, but not in my book.\n\nI forced myself to finish it because I didn't want my $25 meal (Iced Tea was $3.50 for glass, plus tax and gratuity) to go to waste.  I'm not a cheapskate, but damn I can have some great meals for $25.\n\nWill I come back?  Not unless you're paying the bill.",

Both were amazing!  The Penne Alla Arrabiata was made al dente, which is how I love my Pasta and the Arrabiata Sauce had a nice kick to it....just right.  The Caprese Salad was not overdone with Oil, unlike some restaurants.\n\nThe Wife enjoyed her Lobster Salad and Striped Bass.  She passed on Dessert, but I couldn't resist the Warm Italian Doughnuts, so I went for it.....they were so good, I forgot to take a picture of them and they were gone by the time I remembered....:)\n\nThe service was impeccable.  The servers were friendly and attentive.  They were also very knowledgable about the menu and had great ideas for dinner.\n\nOverall, it was an another awesome experience here.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

My favorite was the BBQ Bacon Slider.  The other two weren't that great.  The Fries were just OK.\n\nOverall, it was a nice lunch with friends.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%",

Most restaurants outside the airport charge that much for 3 Sliders.....deal!  The Sliders were average.....I've had better.  Of course, the Dos XX was tasty and refreshing....ahhh!\n\nThis place can get pretty packed and it's difficult to bring large carry on bags in here, so be wary.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",

Here's why:\n\n- The waiter took forever to take our drink order....we seriously could have drank a glass of Wine in the amount of time it took him to come by.  One thing I hate is having to wait for my Wine!\n\n- He screwed up our order and forgot my side order of Bacon Fried Rice.  I was looking forward to trying it because it sounded sooo good.  But when it didn't come out with the entrees, I didn't want to have to eat it by itself.\n\n- The serving of the Salad was mistimed and the entrees came out before we were finished with our Salad and Appetizers.....we felt rushed.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nSONOMA FOIE GRAS\nCHERRY PRESERVE, $25\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A?select=2VpoayF-8SBISGf7cIwHpw\n\nPECORINO GNOCCHI\nSACRAMENTO DELTA ASPARAGUS.

I enjoyed the Gnocchi very much and the Filet was juicy and cooked just right.  I tried a bit of TBH's Pad Thai, and it was pretty good.\n\nOverall, the food was great, but the service sucked.

It's kind of hidden and difficult to find if you're unfamiliar with the place....but worth looking for.  The stairwell is lit with candles...I wonder how long it takes to light all of those every day?  Ha!\n\nThey serve you this Bread that must come from Heaven because it's so awesome!  The only bad part is that the Butter comes out cold and hard....why do restaurants do that?!  It's such a pain to spread it on the Bread.....it was awesome nevertheless.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=2eQrsJcdON3yV2NWBPJq5w#2eQrsJcdON3yV2NWBPJq5w\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=nhgW17m3ur1K6_t2ewSXRQ#nhgW17m3ur1K6_t2ewSXRQ\n\nFor appetizers, we had the Kobe Beef Tenderloin Flatbread, $12.  It was very good and raw.....the server didn't tell us it was raw and neither did the menu (see pics below).  Good thing we didn't mind, but consider yourself warned.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=0hM9bfms7OIUO2zP98tL1w#0hM9bfms7OIUO2zP98tL1w\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=4bqUF6UcLnJTWSHAIVRFpQ#4bqUF6UcLnJTWSHAIVRFpQ\n\nThe Better Half had the Lump Crab, $14 and I had the Annatto Pollo Asado (Jidori Chicken), $27.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=Zp0dRqvTPsRo-B1FmjLXvQ#Zp0dRqvTPsRo-B1FmjLXvQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=0tOnd6OKDEW3P7U6Osq8Ew#0tOnd6OKDEW3P7U6Osq8Ew\n\nFor a side dish, we both split a Calabzitas Con Queso (Squash & Oaxaca Cheese), $6.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=0o4t4YI1Gd10sO4wnhCerA#0o4t4YI1Gd10sO4wnhCerA\n\nThe Jidori Chicken is full of flavor and comes with some Pasta, so it's very filling.  The Squash & Cheese was good, but I thought was a little runny.  Very different flavors for your palette here.\n\nThe service was outstanding and the room is very elegant and romantic.  We washed it down with a bottle of Cabernet of course....yum!\n\nI'm glad we found this place, can't wait to return.\n\nReturn Factor - 99%",

I still miss the old location inside the old Frontier....but those days are long gone.  This one isn't bad, but I don't like the entrance when it's crowded.  It's really difficult to get through the crowd, especially if you want to get to the other side, which has more tables and seats.\n\nThe night we went, there was a good band playing and plenty of people out on the dance floor.  I've never tried the food here.  Too many choices to eat in Vegas.  This place is strictly for partying for us.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",

    "text": "Was in the area and decided to stop by for lunch.  It's a small, casual dining restaurant with seating for about 20 people.  It has a small salsa bar, which is always a plus to me.\n\nAfter browsing the menu for a while, I decided to order a Carne Asada Burrito ($5.25) and a Carnitas Taco ($2.65).  I asked the guy taking my order if they had a spicier Salsa than what they had on the Salsa Bar.  To my surprise, he said they had a Habanero Salsa that they make in the kitchen but it has to be a special request because it's that hot.....perfect!  I asked for a side of that too.\n\nAfter a few minutes, it was ready and I picked up my order from the counter.  The Burrito was huge!  I eagerly took a bite with a little Habanero Salsa.....yum!  Very tasty and spicy!  The Carne Asada had a good flavor to it and was slightly dry, but that's ok with me.  There was a good ratio of Guacamole and Beans in the Burrito and the Tortilla held up well.....it didn't fall apart, which I don't enjoy.\n\nThe Carnitas Taco was just OK.  I thought the Carnitas lacked flavor.  I won't order this next time.\n\nOverall, it was a good meal.\n\nWill I return?  You bet.",

We only come by when we get the urge to have one of their signature dishes like the Dali Chicken or Tofu Lettuce Wraps.  The food tastes the same, but I think they've cut down on their portion size over the past few years while keeping prices the same.....sneaky.  For instance, with the Lettuce Wraps, we only got 3 small Lettuce leaves with the order.  In the past, we'd get 1/2 a head of Lettuce with large leaves.  Also, I remember when we would be able to share entrees and eat family style.  Now, it's not really possible.\n\nThe service here is hit & miss.  The last visit, we had to waive down our server for everything.....refill water glasses, order more Wine, WTH?!  However, the 2 visits before that our server was attentive.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%",

I preferred the Sweet BBQ Wings between the 2.\n\nThe Sausage and Pepperoni Pizza was good as well...not great, but good.\n\nThis place is pretty impressive.  The bar is fairly large and was busy on the night we went. They have a large patio area and could easily handle large groups.  Plenty of TV's in the bar area for sports.  There's also a large dining room area.  \n\nOverall, we had fun hanging out here for 1 night.  However, it's too far away for us to be regulars here.  But if we're in the area, this will definitely be on our list of possible joints to visit.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",

    "text": "My first visit to Hash House A Go Go was for a CMYE event, so I couldn't officially review it.  My second visit was a simple breakfast with The Better Half (TBH).\n\nI ordered the Chorizo Hash (Chorizo, Jalapeno, Cheddar Cheese, Potatoes, Eggs, Biscuit, Peppers & Onions).  TBH ordered the Salmon Benedict.  To wash it down, I had the Mango/Peach Iced Tea.\n\nAfter a short wait, the food came out.  Since we have been here before, we knew what was in store for us....a massive plate of food.  Adam Richman from Man vs Food picked a great spot to host his show.....portions are LARGE!  You have to bring your A-Game to finish your plate.\n\nMy strategy was simple....I will save the Biscuit for the end.  Biscuits are stomach busters.  I added some Tabasco and dove into the Chorizo Hash & Eggs.  It was very good!  The combination of ingredients had a good flavor to it.  The saltiness of the Chorizo combined with the gooey Cheddar Cheese and hot Potatoes made for a huge plate of Awesome!  I wish there were more Jalapenos on it though....it didn't seem to have enough of them.....kind of light.  The Eggs were prepared Over Easy just the way I like it....with the runny Egg Yolk covering the Hash when I broke the seal.  As I said, the Biscuit was last and I ate most of it with the final third of my dish....it was puffy & buttery....delicious and filling.\n\nTBH enjoyed her Salmon Benedict, but could only manage to finish 1/2 the plate.  I packed up the other half for later.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience, just like the first time.\n\nWill I return?  Soon....very soon!",

    "text": "Went to dinner with the Better Half at the Top of the World Restaurant.  I've been there for lunch many times, but have never been for dinner.\n\nWe were seated at a table along the edge of the restaurant, which had a perfect, unobstructed view of the valley.  Since our reservations were for 6:30 pm in the 1st week of April, we knew we were going to get a great view of the sunset.\n\nThe waitress was very friendly and told us to take our time.  Here's a brief summary of our experience:\n\nWine - We ordered a bottle of 2006 Scott Harvey Zinfandel.  It had a nice bite to it....hints of blackberry and pepper made it robust....yum!\n\nAppetizer - Portobello Mushroom, Red Pepper, and Buffalo Mozzarella in Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar......one of our favorites.  Very good.\n\nEntree - Lobster Tail stuffed with Crab meat.  Prime New York Strip with peppercorn crust.  Very, very good.  The meat was cooked just right.\n\nSide Dishes - Sides are ordered separately here.  We had Foie Gras, Risotto Gnocchi with Cheese, and Au Gratin Potatoes with Cheese.  The Au Gratin were a little overcooked, but the rest of them were fantastic!\n\nDessert - They offered small desserts, which is perfect because I really hate large dessert dishes.  I think they're a waste of money and food.\n\nThe Better Half had a chocolate something or other...can't remember right now (Thank you Scott Harvey!) ...I had the strawberry cheesecake lollipops and the cookies & cream lollipops....with dipping sauce and crumbled cookies....yes, they are as good as it sounds.  Check out the photos above to see them.\n\nService - We were treated well from start to finish.  We had to ask for water a few times but that was the only strike against a perfect evening.\n\nI would have scored the restaurant 5 stars, but I felt that the menu was lacking more vegetarian options.  At the time of this visit I was trying to avoid eating meat....not go vegetarian, but just avoid it for a while.  There was only a grilled vegetable option, which sounded \"blah\" to me....so I broke my diet and went for the Prime NY Strip.\n\nWould I visit this place again?  Absolutely!  Awesome place to take your significant other and spend a romantic evening overlooking the Vegas Valley.",

    "text": "After 35+ yrs, I finally decided to give Sushi a try.  I told The Better Half (TBH) that I wanted to give it a shot and she suggested we come here so that I can have a good selection to choose from.  I don't eat Seatfood and have never had raw Fish until now.  TBH and my friends all love Sushi and I kind of feel bad when we have to make different plans because of me....so, here we are.\n\nI was very nervous as we entered the joint and TBH was great because she didn't pressure me to try anything in particular.  I was starvin' like Marvin but my appetite suddenly disappeared as we walked in.  After getting setup with Ginger, Wasabi, Soy Sauce, Jalapeno Soy Sauce I browsed the Sushi buffet line.\n\nI decided that I was going to take it slow and only try a few things....so, I went for Tuna, Salmon, Unagi, 2 rolls I have no idea what they were, Stuffed Tempura Jalapenos, Spicy Tuna Cucumber Rice thingy, and some Tempura fried Roll thingy.  Sorry I don't know the names, but took pics so I'm sure if you're a Sushi enthusiast you'll know exactly what it is.\n\nI enjoyed the Tuna, Salmon, Unagi, & Spicy Tuna.....the other stuff I didn't care for.  I dipped it in a Soy Sauce/Wasabi mix that TBH helped me make....and it helped with the taste.  TBH told me to eat some Ginger every once in a while...which was a blast of freakin' flavor....wasn't expecting that and choked on it.  \n\nI have no idea how to base a rating on Sushi since this was my 1st time....so to me the experience was A-OK, 3 Stars.  I wish they had labels on the Sushi, they didn't.....Overall, I enjoyed myself and will eat Sushi again.  I want to give other Seafood a try now.\n\nWill I return?  I think so.",

It's too small to be a club.....about 1/2 the size of Gilley's.  \n\nThe food here is OK bar food.  Our friends ordered some Wings and I sampled a few....they weren't bad, just OK.  Same goes for the Fries.  Since I didn't pay, I didn't catch the price.\n\nThe waitresses are supposed to be cute/hot....but only 1/2 of them were.  The others looked a little \"sloppy\".  I hate saying that, but if you're going to put your staff in sexy outfits, I'd make sure they are able to meet high standards....especially in Vegas.\n\nOverall, the food/experience was just OK.  The best part is the music.  The joint feels very 'touristy'.  I'd give it another chance under the right circumstances.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%",

I think the large displays of pastries and sweet smell in the air from this joint had something to do with it.   Whatever it was, it worked on her.....we \"had\" to stop and wait in a long line so she could satisfy her craving...LOL.\n\nAfter a short wait, we went through the line and she had a large slice of Chocolate Cake.  We sat in the common eating area and people watched while she enjoyed her Cake.  This is located by a very busy walkway, so the people watching is great.  There's nothing like watching people late at night in Vegas....it's a show all by itself, ha!\n\nThe desserts here are awesome....next time, I want to try a slice of Pizza.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",

I found this Sandwich shop and walked a couple of blocks to check it out.\n\nAfter looking at the menu for a minute, I decided that I wanted a Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich w/Whiz & Jalapenos.  After waiting a few minutes, they brought out my Sandwich.  The Sandwich had a ton of Whiz on it, which is great....but it was light on the Meat.  Usually, places put too much meat on their Steak Sandwiches...not here.  I know Jalapenos isn't part of a traditional Steak Sandwich....and my friends from Philly would've killed me for ordering it that way, but I couldn't help myself....I love to spice it up a bit!\n\nThe Jalapenos were pretty spicy and added to the flavor in my opinion....good proportion of peppers.  The Steak was kind of bland and the bread was just ok.  I've had better Steak Sandwiches....but this did the job.\n\nWill I return?  Probably not.",

I prefer the regular Fries...they're addicting.\n\nThe Onion Rings are thick and massive.  However, I am not a fan of them.  The breading on them are really thin and they're kind of bland. \n\nThe Fried Mac n Cheese is pretty good.\n\nThe restaurant was moved a little over a year ago from it's original location to a much larger space and has a bunch of games in there....Pool, Corn Hole, Darts.  It's definitely aimed at the late night Old Town crowd.  Being open 24 hrs helps them attract that crowd too.\n\nReturn Factor - 75%",

I forgot how much I loved it until I took the first bite.\n\nThe Better Half had the Black Truffle and Wild Mushroom Risotto and I was lucky enough to get a few bites out of her dish....it was simply amazing!  The Black Truffle has a very sharp and distinct flavor that makes your taste buds dance for joy....yum!\n\nI had the Spaghetti Polpette, which was also good, but not as awesome as the Risotto.  The Meatballs were great and the pasta was cooked al dente, which is the right way to cook pasta....they get bonus points with me for that.\n\nService the night we were there was a bit spotty.  We had to flag our server down to get us more Wine and our check when we were ready to leave.  He was a bit inattentive.  The food made up for it though, so it gets a solid 4 Stars.\n\nReturn Factor - 95%",

    "text": "I've lived in Las Vegas since August 1993 and this is by far one of my favorite restaurants.  My fiance and I dine there at least once a month.  We discovered the place 2 years ago based on a referral from a colleague at work.  It was one of the best recommendations.  \n\nThe restaurant is located in a tough to find area if you are not familiar with Las Vegas, but it is worth the effort.  The room is small relative to most of the newer restaurants you see being built, but that is what makes the place special.  You feel like you are getting the attention you deserve.  The Executive Chef/Owner, Roberto, is always around and personally checks on you during your dinner.  The food is excellent, I would recommend the Gnocchi, Escargot, and Lamb.  Those are our personal favorites.  The wine selection is pretty good and pairs up with the meals well.  We hope everyone else enjoys it as much as we do.",

    "text": "This update is long overdue.  Was here for dinner last night with The Better Half (TBH) and four friends.  We were pleased to see many of the same familiar faces working there. We were greeted like old family members coming home for the holidays.\n\nWe started out with a bottle of Chianti before we ordered dinner.  We had all night and was enjoying the company, so our waiter ran down the Specials list and then gave us time to decide.  I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Appetizer ($9) and special ordered a Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Sauce ($14.95)...not on the current menu, was on the old menu from a few years ago, but it's our favorite and they have no problem whipping it up.  TBH ordered the Escargot ($8.95) and the Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Sauce ($14.95).\n\nThe Portobello Mushroom appetizer was excellent....the Mushroom was juicy and the Sauce that came with it complimented the dish well....it was a Tomato based Sauce that didn't overpower the dish.  It's a nice sized portion that can easily satisfy two people or four people with a light appetite.\n\nThe Gnocchi of course was perfect....which is why it's our favorite dish here.  The Gorgonzola Sauce was rich & creamy, but not too heavy.  The texture of the Gnocchi was just right....not too soft, which is a common mistake that many restaurants make.\n\nFor Dessert, I shared a Tiramisu ($6) with TBH and I had some Coffee....which is why I'm writing this review early in the AM.  The Tiramisu was very good......light and fluffy, just how we like it.\n\nThe service is awesome.  The server remembered us, even though it's been over 7 months since our last visit....made us feel special.  One thing about this place is that they are always willing to please their guests.  Two of our friends had special order dishes that they were more than willing to accommodate.  This was in addition to our Gnocchi order....which the server remembered how we like it and didn't ask for much direction on the order.\n\nWill I return?  There's no doubt about it.",

Luckily, the Yelp app on my iPhone found one relatively nearby.  I made the trek to seek out their Queso Steak Burrito, which is one of my favorites.  I think they put crack in their Queso Sauce.....that's the only explanation I have for wanting to drive a ways to grab something from this joint.\n\nIt didn't take long for me to finish the Queso Steak Burrito and a Side of Chips.

My friends ordered an appetizer for the table that was a Tortilla with melted Cheese on it.....they insisted that I give it a try.  I did and was instantly a fan....wow, it tasted sooo good.  The Cheese was gooey and had a nice, rich flavor.  We added some Guacamole to it and it was great.\n\nBy the time my Bean & Cheese Chimichanga came out, I was almost full from the complimentary Chips & Salsa plus the Cheesy Appetizer.  However, once I took one bite from the Chimichanga, my stomach kicked into 2nd gear.....it was good!\n\nOverall, it was a nice place to have dinner with friends.  It's very casual.....it was busy when we arrived around 7:30, but was empty by 9:00.....I can never get use to cities outside of Vegas where places empty really fast!\n\nReturn Factor - 70%",

The Pad Thai was ok.  I wasn't blown away from it and wasn't left wanting more.  I asked the server to fry the Tofu crisp and it came out soft.  They should have fried it a little bit longer.  The spice level was appropriate and enjoyable.  I felt the same way about the Fried Rice.  It was just ok.\n\nAtmosphere - The restaurant is small and the tables kind of feel on top of each other.  We prefer a more private dining experience.  We had a party of 6 people and that is probably the most I'd try to take here.  There is enough room to get larger groups in there, but it wouldn't feel comfortable in my opinion.\n\nService - The service was good.  The servers were friendly.\n\nWill I return?  Probably not.....unless I'm invited there by a friend or family member.",

    "text": "Met a couple of colleagues for lunch the other day and saw @Matt S review that mentioned a Pastrami Melt....so I went for it with Fries.  I wasn't paying, so I didn't get the price....I think it was around $7.95.\n\nThe Sandwich came out pretty fast.  It tasted pretty good, but the Bread was greasy!  I understand it's a melt, so it should be kind of like a Grilled Cheese Sandwich.....but it was much more oily than that.  The Fries were excellent and the service was very good as usual.\n\nThis place gets packed for lunch, especially during the weekdays, so get there before Noon if you don't want to wait.\n\nReturn Factor - 75%",

    "text": "Since I've been to Napoli and have had Pizza from the city, I couldn't wait to give this place a try.  I've heard so much about it, it was time for me to visit.\n\nMy son and I came here after a couple of hours at the Pinball Hall of Fame.  We browsed the menu and decided on getting a Diavola Pizza (Crushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil.) and a Settebello Pizza (Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Roasted Fennel Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil.)  We planned to split each Pizza in half and share it so we can taste both.\n\nWhen the Pizza arrived, I was pleased to see that it was very similar to the Pizza I had in Napoli.  The first Pizza out was the Settebello.  When I bit into the first slice, I could immediately taste the Fennel Sausage and Mushrooms.....it was sooo good!  The crust is thin and slightly burnt on the bottom, just how I like it.  The ratio of Cheese to Sauce was perfect.  This was a good Pizza Pie.\n\nThe second Pizza to arrive was the Diavola.  When I took the first bite, the Finnochiona & Red Bell Peppers were the first flavors I could taste....yum!  It too was slightly burnt on the crust.  Another great Pizza Pie.\n\nThe service was good as we were only 1 of 3 tables in the entire restaurant.  We were there around 4 pm on a Sunday....I hope it was just the time of day that was the cause of the slow business.  I don't want to see this place close down.\n\nWill I return?  If I'm ever on this side of Egypt, I will.",

During a recent trip back, we stayed at GVR and decided to walk over to The District and have dinner here one evening.  I was glad to see it was still around, and most importantly that the Pizza was still very good.\n\nThis time I went for the Margherita DOC (Crushed Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil), $13.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/settebello-pizzeria-napoletana-henderson?select=hkekGVh_GJ4QjwweLrCsjw#hkekGVh_GJ4QjwweLrCsjw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/settebello-pizzeria-napoletana-henderson?select=kfsNFds_cvzeN1IEoAjqZQ#kfsNFds_cvzeN1IEoAjqZQ\n\nThe Better Half opted for the Settebello (Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil), $13.50.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/settebello-pizzeria-napoletana-henderson?select=LnvEfX_z6Tt0JoZnVA7i3A#LnvEfX_z6Tt0JoZnVA7i3A\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/settebello-pizzeria-napoletana-henderson?select=LFy3ytX6YHx_EBvqvMt6yg#LFy3ytX6YHx_EBvqvMt6yg\n\nThe Pizza was awesome of course, just how I remember it.  The Crust was slightly burnt and the ingredients were fresh and full of flavor.  They've kept the quality of their product very high.\n\nOur friend who joined us for dinner was also very impressed.  Although he's lived in Vegas for over 15 yrs, he never had Settebello until now.  He also had the Settebello and was blown away.\n\nService was good.  The server kept our Wine and Water glasses full.\n\nReturn Factor - 92%",

I sampled the Carpaccio, which was phenomenal....it's soo tender and full of flavor.  For Dessert, we all shared 1,000,000 calories worth of dishes (Buttercake, Key Lime Pie, Chocolate Cake, Whipped Cream)....but it's all good when you're dining in a top notch restaurant with great people.\n\nI forgot to mention that we put away 2 bottles of Wine during dinner and a nice glass of Port at the end of dinner.  A perfect way to end an evening.\n\nTip - Don't forget that Mastro's is not cheap.  It's a fine dining joint....expect to pay for it.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

Sold!\n\nSince we just ate dinner, we saddled up to the bar, ordered a couple of glasses of Wine and the following desserts:\n\nFried Oreos, $9\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hanks-fine-steaks-and-martinis-henderson?select=Fr6o_W_g8jRLTOy1xV966A#Fr6o_W_g8jRLTOy1xV966A\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hanks-fine-steaks-and-martinis-henderson?select=UDuyjS-PR-QMefJCeCiRZQ#UDuyjS-PR-QMefJCeCiRZQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hanks-fine-steaks-and-martinis-henderson?select=QArOEViaXlGNlALYT_4ltQ#QArOEViaXlGNlALYT_4ltQ\n\nChocolate Cake, $9\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/green-valley-ranch-grand-cafe-henderson?select=rFCV6YBghUVpNiiND6VEbQ#rFCV6YBghUVpNiiND6VEbQ\n\nLet's start with the Fried Oreos....they are A-W-E-S-O-M-E....!!!  The Oreos are surrounded by a fluffy, Doughnut shell and come with a Creamy Dipping Sauce....when you mix the two together and bite into it, you feel a slight crunch from the Cookie of the Oreo....then all of the flavors combine in your mouth to take you to nirvana....yes, it's that good!  Trust me.\n\nThe Chocolate Cake is pretty amazing too.  However, I've had great Chocolate Cakes before.  What sets this place apart is the Fried Oreos.  It's so addicting that we stopped here every night of our stay to have them.  It's a must try if you're in the area.\n\nReturn Factor - 100% (as long as the Fried Oreos are on the menu)",

The music is loud, which is perfect for the atmosphere and vibe here.\n\nSince we already had dinner, we were only here for cold Beer.  I had a Dos XX Lager and the rest of the group had Heineken.\n\nService here was so/so.  Our server started out well by getting us our drinks right away, but she wasn't too attentive as the night went on....we had to flag her down whenever we needed a refill.\n\nAlthough we weren't eating, we received complimentary Chips & Salsa....they were average.  The Salsa is very mild, no kick to it at all...what I like to call, Tomato Sauce Salsa.\n\nI'll have to come back and try the food.\n\nReturn Factor - 70%",

    "text": "I was very excited to have dinner here.  The Better Half & I have been wanting to give it a try for a while.  We had several friends visiting this weekend and decided to have a group dinner here.\n\nThere were 11 of us in the group.  Before dinner, we gathered at the bar to have a pre-dinner drink.  The bartender was very friendly and helpful.  He took several pictures of the group at our request and was patient as we gave him 5 different cameras to take pictures with.  The whole time he cracked jokes and told us he would take as many pictures as we wanted....+1 in my book for the service.\n\nOriginally, we had a reservation for 15 people but 4 didn't make it, so the hostess had to rearrange the table.  The hostess came to get us 10 minutes after our original reservation time....not bad for a last minute change like that.\n\nWe were seated and our server immediately asked me if we wanted the wine list and who were the wine drinkers in the group.  I gave her the headcount and instructed her to keep our wine glasses full until I said stop.  She obliged and went to get the wine.  I ordered a Malbec from Argentina, it was nice and earthy with hints of blackberry & pepper....perfect! +1 for the wine.\n\nThe server made several recommendations for the group and we placed our order.  As a complimentary appetizer, they brought out a tray of 3 different flavors of French Fries.  From what I could tell the flavors were BBQ, Plain, and Garlic & Herbs....served with 3 dipping sauces....BBQ, Horseradish, Ketchup.  They were good, the Garlic & Herbs was the best of the 3.\n\nWhen the food came out, it was presented beautifully on the plates and cooked exactly how we all ordered it.....that's rare for a group this large.  Normally there is one or two that has to send it back because it wasn't cooked right, but not tonight!  I had the 10 oz Filet and ordered it Medium Well.....it was tender and the knife sliced through it like butter.  It had a nice juicy flavor with a smokey & peppery finish.....a great pairing for the Malbec...nom nom nom!  +1 on the Steaks.  I took a few pics of the Steaks for foodie viewing pleasure.\n\nFor a side dish, I ordered the Truffled Mac 'n Cheese....again, great pairing for the entree....I highly recommend it.  The Asparagus was good too.\n\nNobody had any room for dessert, so I can't comment on that.  Overall, the dinner was a big hit with everyone.\n\nWill I return?  You bet your Steaks I will!!",

We didn't order off of menus, someone picked the dishes and we all sampled everything.  I wish I asked what the heck I was eating because it was awesome.....however, I was too caught up in the great conversation I was having with friends and my Wife took care of putting stuff on my plate to sample, so I didn't get the names of the dishes.\n\nThe service was very good.  They made sure our plates were always full.  The only downside is that their credit card machine is old school and takes forever to close out a check.\n\nI know this is a useless review for 90% of the people out there, but for those who haven't tried Indian food, I recommend giving it a try.....I was pleasantly surprised and can't wait to go back and try more dishes....this time I'm taking notes.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

Since my first bite into an In-N-Out Burger at their Camarillo location when I was in High School, I've been hooked.\n\nNow that I'm well into my 30's, my visits to In-N-Out have dwindled to only a few times a year.....I can't seem to burn the calories like I use to, so visiting one is a huge treat for me.  Last night was one of those nights.\n\nI ordered a Double Double & a Cheeseburger & Fries.  Of course, they came out prepared just like I remember them.....Sloppy, Drippy, and Nom-ilicous!  I am talking about the Burgers....ok?  The Fries are my fav's too.....you can always tell that they were just cut moments before I walked into the door.  I love it!\n\nThis location is the closest to my house, but for some reason I've never eaten here.  The drive thru was a madhouse of course, but there was no line inside....bonus!  I love watching them prepare the food as I wait....It amazes me that they can crank out so many burgers and fries so efficiently and consistently.....one of the major reasons why I come back.\n\nWill I return?  That's a stupid question.....of course!",

    "text": "It has been over 1 year since I've been to Kona Grill.  A lot has changed on their menu, which is a good thing.  The Better Half and I were regulars here for many years but got tired of the same old menu and stopped coming last year.  I met a friend here for lunch this past Friday and was glad to see new menu items.\n\nSince it was Friday, we decided to sit at a table at the bar.  Friday afternoons are happening at Kona Grill, so it was great for people watching.\n\nThey have a special \"Pairing Menu\" where you can order any 2 items for $8.50.....what a deal!  The Sandwiches on the menu are 1/2 Sandwiches, so keep that in mind.  I went for the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich and the Avocado Chicken Wrap.  To wash it down I ordered a Stella Artois.\n\nThe food came out fast and our waitress was very attentive.  My Wrap & Sandwich didn't come with Fries, which was a good thing....I'm trying to cut back on Fries.  The flavor of the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich was amazing!  Full of flavor....and the Bread was delicious.  The proportion of veggies in the sandwich was good too....no single flavor overwhelmed the Sandwich.  The Wrap was just as good.  The Avocado and Chicken were distributed evenly in the Wrap......I hate it when stuff in a Wrap is bunched together so you only taste a single flavor.  That wasn't the case here.....very good.  As a big eater, I was left wanting more though.....but it was probably good for my diet, ha!\n\nMy friend and I put away several beers before we called it a day.  Overall, I was pleased with the food, service, and menu selection.\n\nWill I return?  You bet, I want to try more of the new menu items.",

We've driven by it dozens of times and it appeared to be a small joint that served Gelato.  When we arrived, we were pleasantly to find a restaurant that offered much more than Gelato.\n\nMenu items we've ordered during our visits:\n\nSpicy Pepperoni Pizza (Di Napoli Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Spicy Pepperoni, Tuscan Olive Oil), $9.50\n\nClassic Pizza (Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Italian Sausage, Mushrooms, Grana Padano, Tuscan Olive Oil), $9.95\n\nSausage & Peppers Panini (Hot Italian Sausage, Wood Fired Onions, Roasted Red Peppers, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Tuscan Olive Oil, Grana Padano), $7.95\n\nGrilled Cheese Panini (Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Provolone, Gorgonzola, Fresh Tomato, Hint of Honey), $5.95\n\nGelato & Sorbet, $3.99 ea\nRaspberry\nCookies n Cream\nTiramisu\n\nThe Pizzas are by far my favorite menu item.  They're really good.  I didn't expect to find that in a Gelato joint!  The Panini's are ok, the Sausage & Peppers Panini was too soggy.  The Grilled Cheese Panini was good.\n\nThe Gelato & Sorbet is awesome.  Raspberry and the Cookies n Cream are my 2 favorite.  You can sample as many as you like before you buy, that's what I like to do! :)\n\nOverall, it's a nice casual restaurant to visit.  It's order/pick up at the counter, limited service, but the food is great.  The worst part about coming here is the parking.  There's a tiny parking lot with a handful of spots in the back of the building.  If that's full, you'll have to park down the street, which isn't very convenient...especially during the blazing hot Summer.\n\nReturn Factor - 70%",

It's in a shopping center just off Mayo & Scottsdale Rd....for some reason, this shopping center doesn't do very well, places close down frequently.  We're happy that this hasn't. \n\nHere are some items we've had here:\n\nMexican Bean Dip, $4.99\n\nSpinach Con Queso, $5.99 \n\nNachos, $8.99\n \nOwner's Chimichanga (Shredded Chicken, Black Beans, Cheese, Rice, Pico de Gallo Charrio Sauce w/Jalapeno Cream Sauce and Green Chili Sauce, Sliced Poblano Peppers, Cheese, Shredded Lettuce and Sour Cream), $13.99 \n\nUltimate Chimichanga (Roasted Pork, Rice, Pinto Beans, Cheese, Green Chili Sauce and Pico de Gallo), $15.99\n\nThe food is very good.  My fav's are the Nachos & the Ultimate and Owner Chimichangas.  The Bean Dip and Spinach con Queso are very good too, but if you get those don't get a large entree like the Chimichangas because it's too much food.\n\nThe servers are friendly.  The restaurant can get packed during happy hour and peak dinner hours.\n\nOverall, it's a nice neighborhood family restaurant.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",

    "text": "Came here for lunch with my Mom.  It has been a while since we've eaten here.  Since it was Sunday and the NFL games were on, we sat in the bar area.  I'm glad we did because they have Happy Hour all day during the games.\n\nWe ordered Chips & Salsa to munch on while we waited for our entrees.....it's not complimentary.  I ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger Deep Dish Mini-Pizza, which was 1/2 Off during HH.  Mom ordered the BBQ Bacon Chicken Sliders & Fries, which were $2 Off during HH.  To wash it down, I ordered their Oktoberfest Beer special on tap.\n\nThe Chips & Salsa were pretty good.....it's not authentic, but we didn't come here for authentic Mexican Food.  The Chips were warm and fresh and the Salsa had a nice kick to it....I'd rate it Medium.\n\nOur food was ready after a short wait.  My Deep Dish Mini-Pizza was just the right size.....the Crust was moist and buttery and it really tasted like a Bacon Cheeseburger!  Mom was surprised because her plate looked like a mountain of BBQ Bacon Chicken Sliders! (see pics)  There were 4 Sliders on her plate and a mound of Fries.....she told me I would have to help her finish it.....thank God I only ordered a Mini-Pizza!\n\nI tried the Sliders, which were excellent.  I'm surprised more restaurants don't offer something like this.  The Hickory Smoked Bacon and BBQ Chicken flavors accented one another and the BBQ Sauce had a good tangy flavor to it.....not overly sweet, which I don't enjoy.  The Shoestring Fries were pretty good too....but I didn't have enough room to eat very many of them.\n\nThe Oktoberfest Beer hit the spot too....I was hoping for a little more hoppy flavor, but it was fine.\n\nOverall, it was a great lunch experience.\n\nWill I return?  You bet!",

They have Happy Hour all day long during the NFL Football games.\n\nThis visit we ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders ($5.75 happy hour price) and BJ's Favorite Mini Pizza ($5.00 happy hour price).  To wash it down, I had an IPA.\n\nThe food came out quickly.  I ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders and dove right into it.  They were awesome!  The combination of Pulled Pork, Onion Ring Strings, and tangy BBQ Sauce went well together.  The Onion Ring strings had a nice sweet taste and the BBQ Sauce was tangy and balanced the palate.....the Pulled Pork was very juicy and full of flavor.  Sooo good.  I ordered Wedge Cut Fries with the Sliders and they were cooked just right....not under/over cooked.\n\nMy Mom couldn't finish her Pizza, so she gave me the last couple of bites.....it was very good as well.  The thick crust was soft & buttery with the edges slightly crispy....hmmmm!\n\nOverall, another awesome experience @ BJ's!\n\nWill I return?  Hell ya!",

It wasn't bad....a little lighter than I expected, but not bad.\n\nThe Burger came out after a short wait and I devoured it in short order.  It was pretty good and the portion is large...filled me up nicely.\n\nAfter dinner, we hung out and watched a little baseball.  It was trivia night and it was kind of hard to follow the game with all of the trivia announcements.  Our waitress was nice and friendly and kept our glasses full.  Overall, a good night out.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",

The restaurant is located inside of an old indoor mall that's not in a good part of town....I'm glad we were here for lunch and not dinner.  Everyone was looking at us like we were from outer space.  We were here for the food, not the ambiance...here's what we ordered:\n\nCarnitas Tacos, $1.25 & Pastor Tacos, $1.25\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tortas-ahogadas-guadalajara-chandler?select=Xqb_g5Q8wCiIOxz3Gegftg#Xqb_g5Q8wCiIOxz3Gegftg\n\nPastor Burrito, $5.75\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tortas-ahogadas-guadalajara-chandler?select=_QobIQhnl1-00UTl7CnhlA#_QobIQhnl1-00UTl7CnhlA\n\nMexican Coke\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tortas-ahogadas-guadalajara-chandler?select=DAXSRhnY8v_qs4qo8cmbzQ#DAXSRhnY8v_qs4qo8cmbzQ\n\nThe Tacos were amazing...served Street Taco style, they were simple but very good.  The Pastor Burrito was average....the Pastor was very dry, which is unusual to me....Pastor is generally juicy and full of flavor...this was dry and full of flavor...different and it didn't appeal to me.  The Burrito comes with Beans and Rice inside.\n\nThere's a Salsa bar with a handful of choices for you to place in small, plastic cups.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tortas-ahogadas-guadalajara-chandler?select=WfCsN36Irna9lPTznkcq3g#SguCSpOh3tNAtHMJbK1CQA\n\nThey have Mexican Coke available here...which is my fav and it comes in larger than average bottle (500 ml).  When you're done eating, you leave your empty bottle on your table and they will come pick it up for you....at least that's what I think you're supposed to do.  We looked around and didn't see a place to put empty bottles....we didn't want to throw them in the trash because there's recycling value to them.  During our meal, we watched several other tables leave their bottles on the table when they were finished, so we assumed that was expected.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tortas-ahogadas-guadalajara-chandler?select=WfCsN36Irna9lPTznkcq3g#DAXSRhnY8v_qs4qo8cmbzQ\n\nOverall, the food was OK.  When we left, it didn't leave me wanting more.  I'm not sure I would drive all the way back here again.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%",

It's light and fluffy, like a dinner roll.\n\nThe Pizza is a Chicago style thin Crust with a slightly sweet flavored Sauce.  We ordered it well done, and it came out perfect.  It's a legit Chicago style Pizza...the Pizza reminds me of a place called Fox's Restaurant and Pub in Beverly.  Very good indeed!\n\nThe servers here are very friendly and provided great service during our visit.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

Also, bring your own napkins too.....I couldn't find any in the eating area.....weirdness.\n\nReturn Factor - 40%",

    "text": "My Wife and I have been wanting to try Donovan's for a very long time.  It's taken us 2 yrs to finally give it a try.  After browsing the menu, we decided to order:\n\nPrime Peppercorn Filet 10 oz, $53\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/donovans-steak-and-chop-house-phoenix?select=Did6OCytPePzwEjhjLBz6A#Did6OCytPePzwEjhjLBz6A\n\nNorth Atlantic Salmon, $32\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/donovans-steak-and-chop-house-phoenix?select=Eq4wjwTn5jyNpL_bFoq_bQ#Eq4wjwTn5jyNpL_bFoq_bQ\n\nSkillet Fried Potatoes w/Saut\u00e9ed Onions & Peppercorn Gravy (comes with the entree)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/donovans-steak-and-chop-house-phoenix?select=aYlGbe8XrtjZ_iN9QD8BgQ#aYlGbe8XrtjZ_iN9QD8BgQ\n\nThe joint is upscale and the ambience is pleasurable.  Definitely not a place where you want to take small kids who are loud.  We were very impressed by the traditional, dark wood decor and bronze western themed statues.\n\nIt took a while to get our food...much longer than expected.  But it's a fine Steakhouse, these types of things takes a while.  We enjoyed each other's company while we waited, no big deal.  We knew there was a problem though when a supervisor or manager came up to apologize for the length of the wait...that made us pay attention.  We also noticed that we hadn't seen our server for a while.  We then noticed that a different server was coming to our table to pour Wine from our bottle...I jokingly said \"hey you must be our new server\"...he had a slight grin and then went away.\n\nOur food finally arrived and I couldn't wait to dig in.  I had the Peppercorn Filet and after the first bite knew it wasn't for me.  There was way too much Peppercorn on it for me.  Normally, I like it but this was a bit much...my bad for ordering it instead of a regular Filet.  See the pic I posted and you'll see how much Pepper was on there.  I was hungry and it was my fault for ordering it, so I ate it.  The Fried Potatoes I ordered for the side dish was ok.\n\nThe Wife enjoyed her Salmon a lot.\n\nAfter we ate dinner, the bus person cleared our table and we sat for a while...where the heck was our server?  I think he might've went AWOL....who knows, but after a while the other server who came by earlier stopped by to check on us.  Normally, if a server goes home sick or takes a long break another server will let you know that they'll be taking care of you...but that never happened here.  Since it was my Wife's birthday, she received a complimentary Creme Brulee...nice touch and she enjoyed it, saved the place from getting rated 2 Stars.\n\nNext time I will try something different.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",

    "text": "One of our favorite local bars to grab a bite and watch the game.  It was my hangout joint during the NFL season this year.  They have a decent selection of seasonal Craft Beer and their Burgers are awesome.  Here are a few items we've had over the past year:\n\nZipp's Wings - $7.95 We get them Extra Hot....and they are extremely hot, but very good!\n\nBasket of Fries/Onion Rings/Sweet Potato Chips - $3.25  The Fries are superb.  The Onion Rings & Sweet Potato Chips are \"meh\"...the Rings are soft/crunchy and don't hold together well.  The SP Chips are only good when they're hot & fresh...after a few minutes they get chewy and don't taste good.\n\nNachos - $6.50  They're ok, nothing special.  Served piled high, it can easily feed 2 or 3 normal sized people.\n\nBurgers - $8.49 The 1000 Island is my favorite, sooo good!  The Sweet Jalapeno is pretty good, but not spicy enough.  BBQ Bacon is really good too...a high quality Western Bacon Cheeseburger.  Black and Bleu is awesome too but I have to be in the mood for it.\n\nBesides the food and beer there are tons of large TV screens to watch sports.\n\nThere's no question we'll be back.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

They each have slightly different flavors and textures.  \n\nI didn't care for the Chicken Wings.  They douse it in Buffalo Sauce here....it's not \"baked\" into the Wing, so it's more like a dipping Sauce.  I prefer it the other way.\n\nThe Fries, Breaded Mushrooms, and Mozzarella Sticks are so/so.\n\nThe Garlic Cheese Bread is awesome.  I could easily order 2 of those and a bottle of Wine and I'd be good to go.\n\nThe service here is hit & miss.  It's a young group of servers and they haven't quite learned real customer service yet.  However, not much you can expect from a chain pizza joint.\n\nIt's too far out of the way for us to come here on a regular basis.  If I'm paying full price, there are other Rosati locations closer to our home.  However, if there's another Groupon with 50% off, it will be worth the drive.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%",

Located in Kierland Common,  I love how convenient it is to a large parking lot and garage.....easy in/out access.  I also love the counter seating option.....makes for a very quick meal and comfortable for dining alone.\n\nMy two favorite dishes here are the Chorizo and Egg Burrito, $6.00 and the Breakfast Sandwich (Eggs, Bacon, Mayo, Cheese), $6.50.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jvnMR2D-YVtnQWCP4PN_kw?select=eHfPsCEtTbF1_xC8RoWe4A\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jvnMR2D-YVtnQWCP4PN_kw?select=1OXc4iFyfif-X4YZl0O2mw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jvnMR2D-YVtnQWCP4PN_kw?select=fxHDSdlPpvOJXGviWzt1YA\n\nThey're both very simple dishes, but done very well.  The Eggs are prepared scrambled in both dishes with the right proportion of Meat.  Their homemade Salsa goes really well with the Burrito....I just wish it was spicier...although my tastes are on the spicier side than most people.  The portion size of these dishes are just right too, not too much and not too small....I don't need to order 2 dishes to feel full and 1 dish doesn't leave me feeling guilty.\n\nAs a bonus, the service here is great.  They're always friendly and spot on making sure my Coffee cup stays full or that I'm satisfied before they give me the check.  It's not one of those places that sets your check in front of you while you're eating.....it's one of my Pet Peeves when dining out.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy coming here.  I look forward to my next visit.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

    "text": "Another stop on the Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition, I've had this place bookmarked since last year's Pizza Bender Tour.  I was eager to finally get to try it out.  I asked for 2 Slices of Sausage Pizza, but the girl behind the counter told me that all they had was what was in front of me.....wow, this was the first time I've been told that I couldn't customize my Slice order from a Pizza joint.\n\nOK, so I browsed the available Pizza Pies and decided to order three Slices:\n\nPepperoni & Jalapeno\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=kfLqk6iyi4eYWlLz45uuPw\nMeat Pie (Bacon, Sausage, Pepperoni, Ham, Meatball, on a Double Crust)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=69kV9XIlg2VoR8DTHSuqng\nSuper Meaty (Bacon, Sausage, Pepperoni, Canadian Bacon)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=9-R9RYbmNcXlysJbumdR9g\n\nThe total damage was 14.38 for 3 slices.....which seems like a lot to me, but  I couldn't see the per Slice price anywhere on the hand written menu.....so I just paid the bill and moved on.\n\nIt was lunch time (around 12 pm) and it was beginning to get really busy, so I quickly jumped on an open table near the door.  I asked for my Slices to be \"well done\", so it took a few extra minutes to heat them up.  It didn't take too long before I was called.\n\nOnce I brought the Pizza back to my table, I quickly realized that I ordered too much Pizza.  I could easily eat all 3 Slices, but then I'd feel too full.  The Slices are pretty big, so consider yourself warned!\n\nThe first Slice I went for was the Meat Pie.  The Crust is much thicker than the other Slices of Pizza and the Meats are buried within a ton of Cheese.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=q1Ts-19RUkbAy2GEi11Ciw\nI liked the flavor of it although I couldn't taste the Meatballs.  The Bacon, Ham, Pepperoni, and Sausage flavors were easily identifiable and delicious.  The Double Crust was more on the edge of the Slice than throughout the Pie.  Despite wanting to eat this with my hands, I had to commit the Mortal Sin of eating Pizza and ate it with a fork because the weight of the Slice was too much for the thin Crust to bear.  Next time I'll probably just go with the Super Meaty, which is the same ingredients on their normal Thin Crust.\n\nNext up I went for the Jalapeno & Pepperoni Slice.  Since it's NY Style Thin Crust, you have to fold this bad boy.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=ZiF9E3htkJ-ux6JLyyZtkg\nThe Pepperoni was full of flavor and the Jalapenos packed a nice kick.  The Crust was nice and crispy since I asked for it to be \"well done\".\n\nLast but not least was the Super Meaty.  I wasn't sure if the crust would hold up with all of that Meat on it, but it did.  The Slice was full of flavor and as I mentioned above, like the Meat Pie, I could identify every Meat on the Slice except the Meatball.  This Slice is the Thin Crust version of the Meat Pie.....very delicious.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=Gx_4cQ3K4pBUBY6L9974aQ\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the Pizza here at Joe's.  However, I thought the prices were a bit high compared to other Pizza joints in Vegas.  I guess being so close to the Strip is a big factor.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%",

I decided to give it a shot for lunch.\n\nFood - They use Boar's Head meats here, which is always a good thing.  I asked the guy behind the counter what the most ordered cold sandwich was....he said the #2 Italian.  So, I went with the recommendation.  I also added in Fried Raviolis as they looked so tempting on the menu.  The food was pretty good....not great, but good., which is why it got 4 stars from me.\n\nAtmosphere - It is kind of like Roma Deli, only smaller.  They sell canned/packaged food as well as a good selection of hard to find sodas and ice cream.  The family is clearly from New York & are fans of the Mets.\n\nWill I return?  Yes, because there are other sandwiches I'd like to try.",

Why?\n\n- Because their portions are much smaller.\n\n- Prices increased.\n\n- Quality of the food downhill.\n\nMy most recent visit the other day I ordered a 7 Layer Burrito ($1.99) and 2 Bean Burritos ($1.09).  The Bean Burritos were the size of the ones they sold a few years ago for 69 cents....now they're $1.09?  They're freakin' tiny and unsatisfying.  The 7 Layer Burrito has taken a huge hit in quality too.....all of the ingredients tasted bland.....blech.  Also, Taco Bell has the habit of not putting out their Fire Sauce for people to use....only Hot & Mild.....and when you ask for some, they give you 2 packets for each item.  I can easily use up 4 or 5 per item....whatever.\n\nOverall Value - Even though I spent less than $5, it was garbage.  Only reason why I stopped by was because of old memories of good junk food.\n\nWill I return?  Eventually, someday.....but not anytime soon.",

The wait wasn't too bad and I had 2 Slices sitting in front of me in no time.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Gdv3qhsDeQzZ2Ag-Tzq6vA?select=Kd1MjIC1FEmb1NcRzu0CgA\n\nThis is NY Style Pizza folks.....it's folding time!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Gdv3qhsDeQzZ2Ag-Tzq6vA?select=Wf2-VSjEYuTk7kPcwtDlEA\n\nThe Pizza was piping hot and since I ordered it \"well done\", nice and crispy too!  The ingredients is top notch.....Pepperoni & Sausage were full of flavor and the Cheese was very good.  It was kind of greasy though.....so if you're averse to a little Pizza grease, be prepared to daub it with some napkins.\n\nThe 2 Slices ran around $7 or so and was worth it.  Very satisfying.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Gdv3qhsDeQzZ2Ag-Tzq6vA?select=GveEMS_F2IHPBy7rkRu3zA\n\nReturn Factor - 90%......there are so many other menu items I want to try!",

    "text": "Met a colleague here for lunch the other day.  It was my first visit to Frank & Fina's.  I arrived early and was seated promptly by the hostess.  While I was browsing the menu, the owner Frank came out with Chips & Salsa and asked for my drink order suggesting a Margarita or Beer....hmmm, ok!  You don't have to ask me twice in a Mexican Restaurant if I want a Margi or Beer.  I ordered a Pacifico....what the hell, I don't have to go into an office and my afternoon was clear.\n\nWhile I waited for my friend, I decided I'd order the Nachos.  He arrived a few minutes later saw my Pacifico and ordered one for himself....I love how contagious Beer in a Mexican Restaurant can be!  We ordered our lunch and I like how the waitress asked me if wanted Jalapenos on my Nachos....I asked her if they could cut it fresh and put a lot on top...she said yes.\n\nWe had a nice conversation while we waited for our food, which came out a short time after we ordered.  The place was packed for lunch and I expected the service to be much slower, but it wasn't.\n\nThe Nachos were very good.  The proportion of Cheese, Guacamole, and Sour Cream were just right.  The proportion of Salsa and Onions were good too, relative to the amount of Chips.  The portion was on the Appetizer menu and it could easily feed two or three.  It's not a huge pile of Nachos like you find in some restaurants. For $5.50, it's not bad.  The flavor of all the ingredients were very good too.  The only complaint I have is that the Chips are too thin....they broke easily with the slightest amount of pressure....which forced me to eat most of the Nachos with a Fork.  That's sacrilegious to some Nachos aficionados...LOL\n\nWe had another Pacifico and continued our conversation for a while after lunch.  It was a pleasant experience.  As a bonus, I ran into two friends I haven't seen in 8 yrs who were sitting a the table next to us.\n\nOverall it was a good time.\n\nWill I return?  Of course!",

What class is this for?\"\n\n....he says \"Health\".\n\n....I laugh my ass off and ask him if he's serious.  Apparently, he was.  They were studying the nutritional contents of Fast Food and if he brought in 34 Tacos for the entire class he'd get extra credit on his project.\n\nOf course, this was too funny to pass up so of course I agreed to do it.  So we left for school a little early this morning and I called ahead to ask the employees how long it would take to make the Tacos.  They said they'd start working on it and that they would be close to having it ready when we arrived.  10 minutes later we arrived and they were 1/2 way done with the order.  We waited another 5 minutes or so and we were on our way.\n\n34 Tacos ($14.33).....extra credit for kiddo, priceless.\n\nWill I return?  This Del Taco has their act together....of course!",

    "text": "Was going to go to Cabo Cantina at Santa Fe Station for lunch today with the family, but it was closed and didn't open until 3 pm.  So what did I do?  I jumped on Yelp to find an alternative.  What I found was Buzz BBQ which was only 1.5 miles away.\n\nFood - There is a ton of selections to choose from (see pics for menu).  I was going to order the Beef Brisket sandwich and the Pulled Pork sandwich, but the waitress convinced me to try the Tornado sandwich....which has Beef Brisket, Pulled Pork, and Sausage in it.  The sandwich is huge.  I ordered Fries on the side with Blue Cheese Dressing for dip.\n\nThere are 2 sauces on the table.....Hot & Mild.  The Hot is not really that hot at all.....kind of disappointing as I like spicy BBQ sauce.  They get a -1 for that.  They also get another -1 for charging us $.50 ea for the Ranch and Blue Cheese dressing for our Fries.....I think that kind of stuff is petty....especially since our sandwiches were $11 a pop.\n\nThe Tornado sandwich was very tasty.  I can taste the flavor of each meat.  The bun was just ok though....I think they could do better than that.  Even though they didn't have a spicy sauce, I liked how they allowed you to dress your sandwich with the sauce of your choice....I hate it when places drench their sandwiches in sauce.  \n\nService - The service was fast and the server was friendly, +1.\n\nAtmosphere - The restaurant is in an outdoor shopping mall....they have it decked out in Western decor, but it's not really convincing....kind of cheesy actually....but that doesn't matter to me with a restaurant of this caliber.\n\nWe had a clean table & booth and they gave us a roll of paper towels just in case....which is nice touch.\n\nI would have given this place 4 Stars, but the lack of a true spicy sauce and the petty charge for the dressings made me drop them to 3 Stars.  I still prefer them to the Memphis chain that's in town.\n\nWill I come back?  Sure, when I'm in the mood for BBQ.  Next time, I will bring my own sauce....lol.",

There's also plenty of large TV's above the bar, perfect for watching a game.\n\nAfter a short wait the food came out.  I tried the Potato Skins first.  They were pretty good...not the best I've ever had, but above average.  Next, I tried the Sliders which were very good as well.  The Fries that came with the Sliders were ok....the Sweet Potato Fries were definitely the highlight between the 2 Fries.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience which exceeded my expectations.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

They were a little small compared to many of the sliders that you see in restaurants nowadays.....but the portion was fine.  All their burgers are made fresh and hand pressed daily.  I will definitely go back and try some of their other offerings.  The Pastrami Sub looked good as well as the Ortega Burger, which my friend ordered and said was wonderful.  They also have Criss-Cut Fries, which are not usually available in most restaurants.",

It was beans, rice, lettuce, tomato, sour cream, cheese, and guacamole.  They put way too much lettuce in this burrito.  Normally I have a steak or chicken burrito....but opted for the veggie.

    "text": "I heard about Jollibee by reading a Harvard Business Review case on the company and was interested to try it out for myself.  I was surprised to discover two locations in Vegas.  I gave the Seafood City location a try.\n\nI knew it was a Filipino fast food joint that had food that catered to that demographic.  Since I'm an \"white-washed\" Pacific Islander, my taste in food leans more towards a traditional American taste than the islands....so, I knew I was in for an adventure.\n\nI decided to sample a little bit of everything.  I had the Shanghai Rolls, 99 cent Corned Beef Sandwich, 99 cent French Fries, and a Champ Burger.  To wash it down I had a bottle of Water.  Since I ordered to eat in the restaurant, I was issued a number and waited for my order to be delivered.  The order came out in two batches since it took a while to cook my Champ Burger.\n\nThe Corned Beef Sandwich was very small....about the size of a Slider.  It didn't have much flavor to it....kind of bland to me.\n\nThe Shanghai Rolls were very good.  They were tiny, pinky sized Rolls that had the texture of Lumpia.  They were pretty good but you didn't get much for 99 cents.\n\nThe French Fries were just ok, nothing special.\n\nThe Champ Burger was a mess.  It was very sloppy with the Mayo and Ketchup running down the sides of the Burger.  It has a different taste to it....I don't know what it is....but it doesn't taste like a regular Burger.  I didn't like it at all.\n\nThe joint was really busy and had at least 10 people in line during my entire visit, which was around 2 pm.  That's pretty impressive.\n\nWill I return?  Probably not, it wasn't for me.",

    "text": "Dropped by for lunch with a friend.  I love the vibe an decor here....it's very modern and chic.  I ordered a Triple Grilled Cheese Sandwich (Provolone, American, and Cheddar Cheese on Griddled Texas Toast, $7.95 & Tomatoes, $.95).  It comes with a complimentary side of Caesar Salad....bonus!\n\nThe Grilled Cheese Sandwich was awesome!  The thick Texas Toast was griddled perfectly....not too burnt, but not too soft....and the combination of Cheeses was just right.....the Tomato provided a nice, juicy & sweet flavor to the Sammie!  Next time, I'll also add Avocado to the Sammie for $.95 more.\n\nOur server was great too.....patient with us as we talked and browsed the menu.\n\nOverall, it was an awesome dining experience.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

    "text": "Once upon a time, this place rocked.....always packed with people and had a great vibe.  Then, inexplicably, it became a topless strip club....wth?  Where were all the partiers who wanted to sing along with Tommy and his band go?  Who knows.\n\nNow, it's no longer a topless strip club, but it's lost the momentum it once had.  Which is too bad because it was a really fun place to go to meet up with friends, have a few drinks, shoot some pool, have some food, and sing along with the band.  Well, not really sing along, but the bands were so much fun (think Jimmy Buffet style) that you couldn't help but sing along with your drunk friends.\n\nI recently stopped by the joint to see what it was like now.  I walked into the place and it just didn't feel the same.  It's the same building and not much as changed inside the bar, but it was missing the people that made it fun.  It was replaced with other people, but it just didn't seem right.  I had a Beer and left.\n\nDespite losing it's luster and momentum, this place is one of the best places to be during a weekend that Jimmy Buffet is performing in Vegas.  Although Jimmy has opened up a joint at the Flamingo, many Parrot Heads still come here.  Before Margaritaville opened up, this was Parrot Head heaven during those weekends.\n\nWill I return?  Only during a Jimmy Buffet concert weekend.",

I've passed it 100's of times and have never been here.  This was my first visit.\n\nSince it was lunchtime, I was hungry and ordered the Italian Combo Sandwich with Kettle Chips & a Bottle of Water.  The menu is simple and you don't get to pick the toppings of your Sandwich....so that was a bummer to me....I like to select my toppings.  Oh well, no big deal.  On a positive note....they post the # of calories for each menu item....that was helpful....1,040 calories for my Sandwich + 180 Calories for the Chips....I was at 1,220 for the meal...not bad.\n\nThe place is a Bakery and had a ton of fresh Bread & Pastries....all very tempting, but I didn't want to pass out from food coma....I had to get some work and homework done.\n\nI settled into a small table and setup the wireless on my laptop while I waited for my food.  It didn't take long and the food was ready.  I dove into the Sandwich....the Bread was pretty good and the proportion of Meat and toppings was good too.  It was good, but not great.\n\nAfter lunch I moved over to a plush chair in the corner and got to work....got some work done and hung out for a couple of hours.  It was very comfortable.\n\nWill I return?  I think I found a new place to add to my FREE Wifi work rotation....of course!",

I recently came to this location and ordered:\n\nCheeseburger Animal Style, $2.25\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-tempe?select=K7mA8k4ZMqZ0ga-DN0-wdQ#K7mA8k4ZMqZ0ga-DN0-wdQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-tempe?select=EUJfvJBibUcaWvjeggno5w#EUJfvJBibUcaWvjeggno5w\n\nFrench Fries Animal Style, $3.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-tempe?select=MocfGFJGvCqJYX4_rR_7VQ#MocfGFJGvCqJYX4_rR_7VQ\n\nSmall Soda, $1.40\n\nThe Cheeseburger was perfect....had all of the flavor that I've come to love about In-N-Out.  The Animal Fries on the other hand were terrible....they were cold and chewy.  Unbelievable, because they cook it fresh....they must've left this order on the counter while they finished by Burger instead of giving me a fresh order of Animal Fries.  It was a little disappointing because I normally have a 4 or 5 Star experience at an In-N-Out.\n\nOh well, maybe I caught them on a bad day?  \n\nReturn Factor - 60%",

It's cheap, convenient, and fast.  We enjoy these dishes:\n\nGreek Salad, $5.95\nCombo Platter Appetizer (Hummus, Tabouli, Babaganoush, Greek Salad, Dolmades, Falafel), $10.95\nSpanakopita, $8.25\nTraditional Gyro, $7.75\n\nAll of the food is very good and authentic.  This place can get very busy during peak lunch and dinner hours.  We like to go later than normal so we can find a seat and enjoy our meal.  It's also great to order it to go if you don't feel like dining in.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

Tucked away in the corner of the shopping center, there's no way I could've found it on my own.\n\nAfter browsing the menu, I ordered:\nQueso Crisp, $5\nMonster Nachos, $10\n\nThe Queso Crisp was pretty good.  Kind of hard to screw up a Cheese Crisp, so I wasn't expecting anything less than good.  The Monster Nachos was very good.  I am a self-proclaimed Nacho-lover...and I'm a fan of their Nachos!\n\nThe service was so/so on the night we went...they were packed, so it was understandable.  Overall, pretty good experience.\n\n**TIP** - the parking lot can get crazy packed on weekends, so park in the first spot you find.\n\nReturn Factor - 95%",

We decided that we were going to order an Original Sandwich & an Italian Sandwich.....that we we could split each of them and give them both a try.\n\nWhen we arrived, the place was packed.  However, this restaurant knows how to handle volume.  The ordering & payment process was smooth.\n\nI was surprised to see the selection of Chips, Fruit, Beer & Wine, and Muffins & Pastries that were available.  We found a 2 Top table and waited for our number to be buzzed.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, our pager buzzed and I went to pick up our order.\n\nThe Sandwiches are hot & toasted.  I eagerly bit into the Original Sandwich (Roast Beef, Cheddar Cheese, & Creamy Horseradish Sauce).  The Bread was toasted just right and the Roast Beef was tender, it melted in my mouth.  The bite of the Cheddar Cheese & Creamy Horseradish went very well with the meat & bread.....it was like heaven!  I couldn't get enough.....I wish I ordered a full sandwich.\n\nSo, I couldn't wait to eat my half of the Italian (Salami, Capicola, Roasted Ham, Mortadella, Mozzarella Cheese, Roma Tomato, and Zesty Italian Dressing).....again, it was toasted just right.  This sandwich also burst with flavor on my taste buds......oh man, I think I hit the jackpot!!!\n\nThis place was off the hook!  For once, a restaurant lived up to the hype!  5 Stars in my book.\n\nThe only knock for me is that it is very inconvenient for a local to get in/out of Planet Hollywood just to get a sandwich.\n\nWill I come back?

Located inside the Firesky Resort, this restaurant is a nice little Italian joint that has a nice view of their pool and courtyard.\n\nWe came here on a Wed around 12 pm.  There were only 2 or 3 tables when we arrived.  We sat down and ordered lunch:\n\nClub Sandwich w/Fries, $13\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taggia-scottsdale?select=U586HjZ5vZnKRQkcIO9ojg#U586HjZ5vZnKRQkcIO9ojg\n\nSausage Pizza, $13\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taggia-scottsdale?select=HKTmINBakTZ14pnh1lqDmw#HKTmINBakTZ14pnh1lqDmw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taggia-scottsdale?select=SME4BCsSKX8f_bHCcRcMeg#SME4BCsSKX8f_bHCcRcMeg\n\nThe food was really good.  I had the Pizza....it was huge!  Very large for a lunch portion.  It could easily feed 2 people.  Luckily, it isn't heavy.  The Crust is thin and toppings are not heavy.  It's cooked crispy without asking for it that way, so be prepared for that....if you don't like it crispy, I recommend ordering something else.  The flavor was excellent, especially the Sausage which was amazing.\n\nMy colleague had the Club Sandwich and he said it was very good.\n\nThe food and ambiance earns 4 Stars. The service on the other hand gets 2 Stars.  Despite there being only a few tables....it never got packed....the service was very slow.  It took a long time for our food to come out, then it took 20 min for the server to pick up the bill after he dropped it off.  Slow service is a big no-no for lunch....you have to get people in/out quickly.  Luckily, our schedules were clear and we got some work done over lunch, so we made the best out of it.\n\nI may have caught them on a bad day....might back to give it another chance.\n\nReturn Factor - 65%",

    "text": "Had lunch with my Mom here last week.  It has been over a year since our last visit.  It is a restaurant/video poker bar.  The restaurant is on the left side of the building.  We were pleased to see that it was still kept well and clean.  Many video poker bars in Vegas go downhill rapidly.\n\nAfter taking our drink orders, the server told us the Lunch Special was Buy One Burger, Get One FREE.  We decided to go for the Special and ordered a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and a Montana Peppercorn Burger.\n\nAfter a short wait the server brought out our food.  I should have paid closer attention to the menu because the Montana Peppercorn Burger was served open-face with Gravy smothered all over the Burger & Fries.....not exactly what I wanted, but that was my bad.  Mom wasn't that hungry, so she was nice enough to trade with me....so I had the BBQ Bacon Burger.  The Burger was pretty good, not great....the Onion Rings that were served as toppings for the Burger were great.  The Steak Fries that came with the Burger were awesome.....they were cooked just right so that they weren't too soft or soggy.....which happens a lot with Steak Fries....they made it just right.\n\nMom couldn't finish the Gravy smothered Burger, so I had a couple of bites....I didn't really care for it....I'm not a fan of Gravy unless it's with Turkey & Stuffing.  I could barely taste the Peppercorn Burger under that Gravy and Grilled Onions.\n\nOverall, it  was an ok lunch.  Will I return?  Yes, but not for the Gravy Burger.",

Some of the Tacos I've tried are:\n- Taco al Pastor\n- Shredded Beef Taco\n- Carne Asada Taco\n- Carnitas Taco\n- Pollo Asado Taco\n\nMy 2 favs on that list are the Carne Asada & the Taco al Pastor Tacos.\n\nOverall, the food is pretty good and the Margaritas are excellent.  We've only come here during lunchtime and the service is so/so.  Sometimes we get an experienced server and they're good.  Other times we get a young, inexperienced college student that has no clue and forgets to serve us our complimentary Chips & Salsa....that's happened on 2 visits.  The inconsistent service is what knocks them down from a 4 to a 3 Star for me.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%",

Good thing our server, Rosemary, helped us out.  She pointed out that they had a $4.95 lunch menu and that I should try one of those items.  I looked at the lunch menu and decided for that price I'd order 2 items!\n\nI ordered the 1 Topping Thin Crust Personal Pizza w/Sausage ($4.95) and an Italian Beef Sandwich w/Fries ($4.95) with a side of Hot Giardiniera ($.50).\n\nThe food came out after a short wait.  I went for the Beef Sandwich first.....dipped it in a little Au Jus and added some Giardiniera.....after one bite, I WAS HOOKED!  This is some seriously good Chicago style Beef!  I'm sooo glad I ordered it!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA?select=AxzEEvoOb0DEaYNr8YaiVg\nThe Fries were pretty good....they're Crinkle Cut Fries and had the perfect amount of Salt added to it.\n\nNext up was the Sausage Pizza.  I ordered it 'well done' because I prefer my Pizza that way.  They obliged and it came out perfectly!  The Crust was nice and crispy and the Sausage was AMAZING!  Another score!  It reminded me of Fox's Pizza in the Southside of Chicago when my friend took me there.  The size of the Pizza is pretty good too for $4.95!  I'd guess it's around a 10\" Pizza.  I was expecting something smaller....it exceeded my expectations.\n\nOverall, it was an awesome lunch.....good food and good times!  Rosemary, our server, was amazing and friendly.  I love going to places like this where people actually care about their customers.\n\nI can't wait to go back and try their Stuffed Pizza, Deep Dish Pizza, Chicago Hot Dog, and many many more things I saw on the menu!\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

I'm a creature of habit when I find a great Steakhouse, so I tend to order the same thing every time.  Here's what I order here:\n\nWedge Salad w/Blue Cheese Dressing & Crumbles\n12 oz Bone-In Filet, $38\nGorgonzola Mac n Cheese, $12\n\nThe Wedge Salad is a big portion and I have to be careful every time I order it not to get full.  I usually split it with The Better Half.  I wish they had a 1/2 order available.\n\nThe Bone-in Filet is simply magnificent.  It's juicy and full of flavor.  The right amount of marbling and the bone gives this Steak unbelievable flavor....my mouth is watering as I'm typing this.\n\nThe Gorgonzola Mac n Cheese is a big portion for a side dish...plan to share or take home.  It's very creamy and rich....delicious.  It compliments the Filet well.\n\nThe servers here are top notch and always go the extra mile to ensure you have a good time.  If it wasn't so far from civilization (it's in Pinnacle Peak), we'd come here more often.\n\nPS - this is not a cheap restaurant.  If you can't afford to spend the money, don't come here....you'll be disappointed.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

I was curious to see if the quality of the food and experience would hold up.....and yes it did!\n\nWe joined a group of friends here for dinner and they accommodated 10 of us near the bar area.  We were able to enjoy the live music throughout dinner.  \n\nOf course, I had to order my fav dishes here:\n\nWedge Salad\nBone-In Filet\nGorgonzola Mac 'n Cheese\n\nThe food was phenomenal, just like the other location.  The Wedge Salad is fresh and crisp....very refreshing.  The Bone-In Filet is simply out of this world....the Bone just adds so much flavor to it....yum!  The Gorgonzola Mac 'n Cheese is addicting and is worth the nuclear explosion of calories....I just can't say no to ordering it.\n\nThe service is outstanding and we were well taken care of.  Our party of 10 felt like we were at home because we were so comfortable and didn't have to worry about anything all night.  We put away 5 bottles of Wine and the server ensured that we didn't have an empty glass until we were ready.\n\nTip: The food prices are not cheap here...if you can't fade a large dinner bill, I don't recommend coming here.\n\nCan't wait for the next time!\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

It's out of the way, located between the Ft McDowell casino and the Radisson Hotel next door.  If we hadn't parked in the far back parking lot, we would've never stumbled across this place.\n\nAfter browsing the menu, we decided to give it a shot for dinner.

I've never had Risotto with Habanero Orange and Poblano Vanilla flavors before....very tasty and unique.  It's a large portion, even for 2 people.  We didn't realize that when we ordered and also ordered a Cactus Quesadilla for an appetizer.  That was very good too.  Unfortunately, we were stuffed by then and I already ordered the Filet....otherwise, I would've passed on an entree.\n\nThe Filet came out and I ended up splitting it with The Better Half.  We were both pretty full, so we only ate 1/2 of it.  It was very good though and I would order it again.\n\nThe service here was good, I wouldn't say excellent.  I'll come back.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

It will fill you up nice.\n\nIt's never too busy at lunchtime and we enjoy sitting on the \"patio\" out in the mall....makes for great people watching.\n\nStaff is so/so....lot's of college age kids who's first job serving is here, so the service is inconsistent.\n\nOverall it's A-OK.\n\nReturn Factor - 65%",

    "text": "My Son and I stopped by to watch Anthony M try to finish the 3 lb Burger challenge......the Burger was actually 5+ lbs total weight!  (see pics)\n\nWe decided to order some food for ourselves as well.  I ordered the 1/2 lb Open Range Cheesburger ($11) w/Onion Rings ($2) & Loco Bueno Hot Wings ($10).  My Son ordered the 1 lb Big Daddy BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger ($16).  There were 11 people in our party, so I expected the service to be a little slow.\n\nOur food came out in a reasonable amount of time.....the Burger was OK, not great.  The Hot Wings tasted pretty good, but the sauce was not hot enough for me.  I asked for the hottest sauce they had and it was called the Texas Double Pepper.....it had a small kick to it, but it really didn't do much for me.  My Son enjoyed his Big Daddy BBQ Burger....it was huge at 1 lb, but it was nothing compared to the 3 lb Challenge!\n\nAnthony ordered his Burger at the same time we all ordered our food, but he didn't get his 3 lb Challenge Burger until we were all finished with our meals.  Keep that in mind if you want to do this challenge.....it will take 15-20 min longer for it to be ready vs other entrees.\n\nWhen they delivered the challenge Burger, they rang bells, whooped & hollered and made a big deal.  The staff announces it to the restaurant and they count down to start the 30 minute time limit.  Everyone in the restaurant watches as you try to eat this monster.  They advertise it as 3 lbs, which is within range for a normal person.....but it weighs it at over 5 lbs once you add it the 12 pieces of Bacon, Whole Onion, Whole Tomato, 6 slices of Cheese, Bun, and Lettuce!  Crazy!  I give Anthony props for giving it a shot.....he finished 1/2 of the Burger, which is respectful.  The manager told us 150 people have tried it, but only 5 have completed the challenge.  While we were dining there was another challenger at the bar.....we heard he only finished 1/2 the Burger too.  It's a $36 Burger in case you want to give it a try.....\n\nOverall, it was a pretty fun time hanging out with other Yelpers.  The food was just eh....OK.\n\nReturn Factor - 30%",

    "text": "Located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, we enjoy bringing friends and relatives here.  Self parking is a mess here, so I use the valet service that's at the front of the restaurant.  It's 100x easier than trying to find parking yourself.\n\nThe restaurant is huge and offers indoor & outdoor seating as well as seating on the 2nd level.  We've always dined in the main dining room on the 1st floor.  Here are some of the menu items I've had:\n\nSweet Potato Fries, $8.99\nJalapeno Mac n Cheese, $10.99\nBlack Truffle Mac n Cheese, $13.99\nSpinach & Artichoke Dip, $10.99\nBBQ Burger, $12.99\nFilet, $29.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/saddle-ranch-chop-house-scottsdale?select=w5yMCDXjT_g93ur6zj0_QA#w5yMCDXjT_g93ur6zj0_QA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/saddle-ranch-chop-house-scottsdale?select=cJOIml3aeW0BW3G8EzFEbw#cJOIml3aeW0BW3G8EzFEbw\n\nI have to say that both their Jalapeno and Black Truffle Mac n Cheese dishes are some of the best Mac n Cheese dishes I've ever had.  They're a must have with every meal when we're here.\n\nThe Sweet Potato Fries and Spinach & Artichoke Dip are average.  The BBQ Burger is amazing...very juicy and sloppy with the BBQ Sauce dripping out of the sides of the Burger when I bite into it....yum!\n\nThe Filet is above average...I wouldn't say it's one of the best I've had though.  Although I order it slightly Medium Well, I think they leave it on too long because it comes out more on the well side than I prefer.  Most really good Steakhouses will get it right for me.\n\nThe atmosphere here is loud and fun.  There's a mechanical bull if that's your deal...on weekend nights, it's comical to watch the drunks jump on it.  On a few of our visits the server gave us complimentary Cotton Candy for dessert.  They're known for that....it's very good and always a pleasant surprise when we get it.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

I even saw a Black Swan....cool!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=auKWdF71D6A-MqzCJLsY-g\n\nThe 1st round we all went to the buffet near the entrance, which had standard breakfast offerings....we were a little disappointed that it was so small.  I grabbed a few Pastries, Eggs, Potatoes, and other stuff.  The food was so/so (2.5 Stars for this section)....then another Yelper Holly C said that there was a Crepe station in another room past the 1st buffet section....what?!  How did I miss that?!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=7yWOGpZ5VrHcpL2YWdcYnQ\n\nI immediately went to investigate.....yes, there was another huge section of Desserts, a Crepe station, Chocolate Fountain, Donuts, and other goodies.  I ordered a Blueberry Crepe from the nice woman working the station.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=UIQgmkOtmg22t5-_inbfww\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=xbMwXlp78c3N82SeqQxvjw\nShe was very pleasant and curious about what we were doing with attempting to eat at all 7 Buffets in one day.  She did a good job on the Crepe, which tasted awesome.  The other Desserts in the area were very good (4 Stars for this section).....but it really started to fill me up.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=J0YxypAGNZJLQZA9yc_rVA\n\nJust when we thought we saw it all, we discovered that there was a 3rd section of the Buffet!!!  There's a Chinese food section that opens at 11 am....I was done, but a few of the Yelpers I was with went to check it out and said it was very very good.\n\nOverall, this was a hidden gem surprise as we had low expectations for this buffet.  I wish I would have paced myself better so I could try the Chinese food....next time.  3 Stars weighted average for the Desserts and 1st section of the Buffet.  Incomplete on the Chinese food for me because I didn't have any.....other Yelpers loved it.\n\nReturn Factor - 72%",

    "text": "I happened to be in the area and was hungry so I used the Android Yelp App to search for Sandwich joints in the area.  Found this one and decided to give it a shot.  I'm glad I did.\n\nI ordered the Wise Guys Sub (Capocolla, Mortadella, Hard Salami, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Roasted Red Peppers, Pepperoncini Peppers, Provolone, and Basil Mayo) on Ciabatta Bread $6.99, a bag of Jalapeno Chips $.80, and a Bottle of Water $1.99.\n\nThe food came out within a few minutes.  The size of the Sandwich was just right....not too big and not too small.  I eagerly took a bite and was impressed with the flavor that the Roasted Red Peppers brought to the Sandwich.  I've had a lot of Italian Sandwiches and have never had one with Roasted Red Peppers.....additionally, the Basil Mayo added another element to the Sub which made it very good.  The proportion of Meat and toppings was very good.\n\nThe only complaint is that with all of that wet stuff in the Sandwich, the ingredients were sliding off the Bread and it took some work to keep it all together.  I didn't dock them any stars for that....it's more of a preference thing.\n\nOf course the Sandwich came with a Spicy Pickle.....which I didn't think was too Spicy at all.....nice flavor though.  Would have enjoyed a really Spicy Pickle.....was hoping for one.\n\nWill I return?  I live on the other side of town and rarely come to Egypt....but next time I'm near the area, I'll be back.",

The 20\" is a huge Pizza that can easily feed 3 to 4 people.  I love how they use Fresh Mozz instead of the regular Cheese you find at most Pizza joints.  Their Sauce is also very good here.\n\nFor lunch, the Rollatini or \"Calzone\", Big Boy Sandwich, and Filet Sliders hit the spot....you can't go wrong with any of the 3.\n\nOverall, this is one of our fav dining spots in the area.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

The location is conveniently located off the 215 & Flamingo Rd.....so it was easy access for me and them.\n\nThe traditional Lindo's Chips & Salsa is served here, complimentary.  It has the same fresh, awesome taste as the other locations.  Good start.\n\nAfter browsing the menu for a little while, I settled on the Lunch Special #3 \"Tres\".....Beef Chimichanga.  I was going to order a Dos XX or a Pacifico, but since my friends were on lunch from work, I didn't want to throw it in their face that I can drink at lunch and they can't....so I abstained and had an Iced Tea.\n\nThe food came out pretty fast.  The Chimichanga comes with Rice, Beans, and Sour Cream & Guacamole on the side.  It was cooked just right.....the fried Tortilla was crispy, flaky, and not greasy.  The Beef was shredded and full of flavor.  I like to get their signature Salsa and pour it on top of the Chimichanga....because the Salsa packs a lot of heat and has that Smoky Chipotle flavor to it.  I mixed the Beans & Rice together and devoured the plate.\n\nThe service was excellent and everyone had a good time.  We spent an hour after lunch talking and catching up on stuff.....even though we settled our bill, the server ensured our glasses were full and that everyone was ok.  It's the signature service I've come to know and love about Lindo and his restaurants....glad to see it was the same here.\n\nWill I return?  Of course!",

    "text": "After reading all of the great reviews of this place, I was really really hoping for a great sandwich experience.  I don't live anywhere near this place but happened to be in the neighborhood yesterday, so I decided to make a stop here.\n\nI ordered a Regular Sized (9\") Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich with Provolone & Peppers.\n\nThe woman working there was very nice and friendly.  The other customers in the joint appeared to be regulars because she knew them by name and already knew what a few of them wanted......very impressive.  You don't find service like that too often in Vegas.\n\nMy sandwich was very fresh & hot and looked awesome.  However, in the taste department it fell flat for me.  I thought the Beef was a little bland.....it didn't have that distinctive taste that I expect from a Steak Sandwich.  I also thought it could have used more Cheese as I could barely taste the Provolone.  The Peppers were good.....although, I didn't know you had the option to order Sweet or Hot Peppers until I overheard other people asking for them.....wish I would have known, I would have ordered Hot......to be fair, it's printed on the menu on the wall.....but I overlooked it as I was trying to read everything and figure out what to order before someone else came in and cut in front of me.\n\nOverall, it was a pleasant experience and even though the Steak Sandwich didn't do it for me, I will give this place another try the next time I'm in the area so I can try the Pastrami & Swiss Burger and their Italian Sandwich.  Until then, it gets 3 Stars in my book.",

Of course we enjoyed our meal with a few glasses of Sangiovese ($11 ea)....yum.\n\nService here was great and it was a nice dinner during our Staycation.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",

There were so many things on the menu, I didn't know where to start.....\n\nSo, I went with a Pastrami Cheeseburger (Pastrami, Grilled Onions, Provolone, & Mustard on a Burger)....and a Regular Hot Dog.\n\nSince I was dining solo, I sat at the counter behind the Grill.  I waited patiently and watched the short order cook prepare the artery choking goodness for all the patrons and myself.....that was fun.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes my order was up.  I went after the Pastrami Cheeseburger first.....wow, it was tasty.  I liked the proportion of Pastrami to Cheeseburger.....some places put too much Pastrami and it overwhelms the burger....not here.  I also liked how well the Grilled Onions tasted.....they were chopped in med sized pieces which I prefer to the larger sized ones you find in some places.  It was so good, I didn't add anything to it....I ate it as it was served.\n\nNext, I added some Mustard to the Regular Dog and bit into it.  I felt a familiar ~Snap~ as I took that first bite.....awesome!  You don't find too many snapper dogs around town, so I was pleased that I did.  Every bite was full of Hot Dog goodness.\n\nThere are so many varieties of Dogs & Burgers here, not to mention side dishes that I want to try.\n\nWill I return?  I guarantee you I'll be back at least 10 times to try other stuff on the menu.",

It's always in the top 3 choices for the young-ins in the office when they get to pick a place for their special day.  There's plenty of space here to accommodate large or small groups.  Our get togethers are normally in the 20-30 people range and we've never had any issues with service.\n\nThe appetizers are good here.  Potato Skins and Nachos are the two that I've sampled.  I've only had appetizers and drinks here, so I can't speak about the entrees.\n\nI hear it's awesome on the weekends, but that's for a much younger crowd and I outgrew that scene many moons ago.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",

    "text": "Thanks to Groupon, we found this joint.  We dropped in here twice to give it a shot. After browsing the menu, I got super excited...they have Tri-Tip on the menu!!  Growing up in So Cal, BBQ Tri-Tip can be found everywhere in Cali...but is difficult to find anywhere else....so this got me going.  The menu was full of items we wanted to try, so we decided to pig out and order:\n\nTri-Tip Sandwich, $7\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=Jgn7JZ3ziA6OBsPoItZ2iQ#Jgn7JZ3ziA6OBsPoItZ2iQ\n\nPulled Pork Sandwich, $5.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=cylqtkEZkpXEsZbc3-HMVA#cylqtkEZkpXEsZbc3-HMVA\n\n1/2 Rack of Ribs, $12.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=KF-twY_w1ZCAQ99uyYs5qw#KF-twY_w1ZCAQ99uyYs5qw\n\nHot Links Sandwich, $4.00\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=67EY5EuVp1j_lr97QhsL0w#67EY5EuVp1j_lr97QhsL0w\n\nBBQ Beef Sandwich, $5.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=8pDmW_0c8qGWVi_7oLA2oQ#8pDmW_0c8qGWVi_7oLA2oQ\n\nMac n Cheese, $1.65\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=3eMvoA5p-VWPXwtxS1Zeog#3eMvoA5p-VWPXwtxS1Zeog\n\nSlaw, $1.65\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=Ff16sZ5g-n_i6wBAC9x00A#Ff16sZ5g-n_i6wBAC9x00A\n\nRed Beans & Rice, $1.65\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=YIsvjBrObW4DeKkHQ-Fq9A#YIsvjBrObW4DeKkHQ-Fq9A\n\nBBQ Baked Beans, $1.65\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=J3KZogUplw7uUYNz_cP3Fw#J3KZogUplw7uUYNz_cP3Fw\n\nWe sat at a table and waited for our food.  At the table, you have 3 BBQ Sauces available.....Mild, Spicy, and Carolina Vinegar.  My favorite of the 3 was the Carolina Vinegar....tasted much better and spicier than the other 2.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=cRU649rlaIr_VsD-Vl_faw#cRU649rlaIr_VsD-Vl_faw\n\nThe first thing I tried was the Tri-Tip....I dressed it with Hot Sauce and took a bite....it was underwhelming, just ok.  With every bite, I was hoping that more flavor would jump out at me....but alas, I was disappointed.  The Meat was also a bit dry....bummer.\n\nNext I tried some of The Better Half's sandwich that she ordered....the Pulled Pork Sandwich.  I took a bite and was also underwhelmed.  \n\nThe BBQ Beef Sandwich had a little more flavor but was average at best.\n\nThe Hot Links tasted ok, they were spicy....however, it was served on a regular Hot Dog Bun....not much to it.\n\nOk, how about the sides?  I tried a bite from each of them....the Mac 'n Cheese tasted *meh*....like the boxed Velveeta Cheese from the store.  The Red Beans & Rice was not like what I was hoping for (New Orleans Style)....this one was very dry and had a ton of Tomatoes in it....the RBR I've had in New Orleans is much more wet and I don't recall this much Tomato in it.  The best side was the Slaw & Baked Beans....those were actually very good and our favorite out of the 4 sides.  We only ate 2 bites out of the RBR and 1/2 of the Mac 'n Cheese.\n\nLast to try was the Ribs...it had to be good, right?  Wrong....that was dry too....damn!  Even dousing the Ribs with Sauce didn't help too much....they fell off the bone, like they're supposed to, but the meat was dry as jerky.  Maybe that's their style of BBQ?  I don't know, but it wasn't good for us.\n\nI really really wanted to like this place....it had so much potential when I looked at the menu....but I left disappointed.  Oh well, the search for good BBQ continues.\n\nReturn Factor - 10%",

    "text": "Until last night's visit to the Yardhouse I was a big fan....now, I'm not so sure, here's why.\n\nA good friend and his fiance were visiting from California and wanted to get together for dinner & drinks.  Since Town Square is located on the Strip, it was a convenient place for us to meet.  Over the past few weeks I've been drinking a lot of IPA's and Chimay and was telling him that the Yardhouse would be a great place for him to give them a try.  Since they don't have a Yardhouse where he lives in California, we were all very excited.\n\nThe Better Half and I met them at the Yardhouse.  It was pretty packed for a Sunday evening but we were able to find 4 spots at the bar in the corner so we could face each other and get seated immediately.  After browsing the beer menu, we decided on a Stone IPA.....the bartender said they no longer had it.  Ok, how about the Long Hammer IPA?  Nope...no longer carry it.  He proceeded to tell me they only had 1 or 2 of the IPA's on the menu because they are in the process of switching out the menu......what?  WTF is that?  I understand changing out the menu, but not being able to offer what you have listed until you make the change.....that's BS!  Especially for a place that claims to have 100's of beers on tap!  Ok.....well, if that's the case we asked for a Chimay Triple....guess what?  They didn't have any!\n\nAt this point I was a little embarrassed because I hyped up this place as a solid \"go to\" place to enjoy new brews and good food.  We settled for a Ranger IPA and called it a day.\n\nFor food we ordered Hot Wings, 4 Cheese Pizza, Jambalaya, and Sliders.  The Pizza was very soggy, even though I ordered it well done....that's the second time we've had Pizza and it come out soggy....we won't order it again.  The rest of the food was good, but not great.\n\nOverall, it was a disappointing night at the Yardhouse.  There are tons of places in Vegas that serve good bar food, but came here specifically for beers that were not available....and that's suppose to set them apart from the rest.  I hope this was an anomaly and not the beginning of a trend.",

    "text": "After reading many reviews on Yelp and driving past this joint 100's of times, I finally decided to stop by today for lunch to check it out myself.  I decided to give myself a treat after a great workout at the gym.....have to give back some of the calories, right?\n\nI had no idea how it worked and the menu in the restaurant is posted at the front door facing your back when you enter...so you see it when you exit.....what the hell?  Seems very illogical to me, but whatever.  Because I didn't see the menu when I walked in, I had no idea what to do....so I asked the kid at the register, how does this work?  He kind of looked at me with a puzzled expression and said \"You place an order and I take it\"......he was kidding around and explained that there are specialty Burgers that I can choose from or I can \"Create\" my own.  You choose 1/4, 1/3, or 1/2 lb patties, the bread, and the toppings.\n\nAfter browsing the specialty Burgers for a minute, I decided I wanted to order two of them.  I ordered a 1/4 lb Dali Burger  with White Bread & (Avocado, Peppers, Onions, Monterey Jack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, & Southwestern Ranch) and a 1/4 lb Impressionist Burger with Onion Bread & (Cajun Seasoning, Jalapenos, Lettuce, Tomato, Pepper Jack, & Atomic Mayo w/side of BBQ Sauce) and a bottle of Water.  He suggested that I get a side of BBQ Sauce with the Impressionist Burger....I took him up on his recommendation.  Total damage ($11.73), for the Burgers & bottled Water.  The price you see on the menu is the combo price.  He issued me a number and my change and told me they would bring out the Burgers when it was ready.\n\nThe restaurant has plenty of seating and nice comfortable booths....not what I expected.  They also sell Frozen Custard here....since I'm unfamiliar with what that is, I passed on trying it this visit.\n\nAfter a few minutes my order was delivered by the manager.  He apologized because they ran out of Guacamole and substituted it with whole Avocado on the Dali Burger....I told him that was fine.  I started to take pics of the food and when he saw me, he asked if I wanted a picture with the Burger....I laughed and said yes.  What a nice guy.\n\nI jumped into the Impressionist Burger first.....I couldn't wait to try it since it was loaded with Spicy Toppings.....I decided to take the first bite without the BBQ Sauce.  Wow....it was Spicy!  It had a very nice kick to it....not too blazing hot, but very enjoyable.  I am impressed because most joints make their mild....not this one!  Then I tried it with the BBQ Sauce per the cashier kid's advice.....yum!  The BBQ Sauce combined with the spicy flavor of the Atomic Mayo, Jalapenos, and Pepper Jack made this burger taste really good.  I wish I would have ordered a 1/3 lb patty though as the 1/4 lb seemed to be too small with all of the toppings.  The Beef was very flavorful, but I could have used more of it...next time I'll get the 1/3 or 1/2 lb patty....my bad.\n\nAfter devouring the Impressionist, I went for the Dali Burger.  I loaded the Avocados into the Burger and again took a bite before I tried it with the Southwest Ranch Sauce.....it was pretty good, but needed the Ranch.  I poured some of the Ranch with each subsequent bite.....wow, another excellent Burger!  The Onion Bun added to it.....another great recommendation from the cashier kid....he must eat a ton of their Burgers to figure out great combinations of stuff.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience....fresh, flavorful ingredients and the ability to customize your Burger are the highlights of this place.  The one knock would be the Bread....it was very \"doughy\" and just didn't do it for me.....tasted like and had the consistency of Wonder Bread.  Despite that flaw, I still gave it 4 Stars.\n\nWill I return?  I want to try some of the other specialty burgers as well as up the patty size....so, yeah I will be returning soon!",

The weather was awesome, so we dined outside on the patio.\n\nOur server was awesome and made sure our glasses of Wine were never empty.  The food came out pretty fast.  I took one bite of my Ziti and instantly became a fan!  The Bolognese Sauce had the right combination of Spinach & Ricotta to make a heavenly dish....the proportions of ingredients was just right so that any one flavor didn't overpower the meal.  It went great with the glass of Zin.....which had a nice Chocolate-Berry flavor with a slight Peppery bite to it....yum!\n\nOverall, it was really good dinner.

This particular location is the closest BWW to my house, so I frequent it the most.\n\nToday I went for the Sampler.....Nachos, Cheese Sticks, Boneless Wings, and Onion Rings....yeah baby!  I thought the sampler was excellent, except the Nachos which were just OK in my book.  I'm not a huge fan of their Cheese/Chili combo on the Nachos.\n\nWashed it down with an Apricot Wheat beer....went for the Ranger IPA next and then the other IPA they have on tap to end the day.\n\nThe place isn't too busy in the middle of the day, so it was nice to have most of the bar area to myself.  The server was awesome and very helpful.\n\nWill I return?  Of course...I will be here often.",

I passed on Fries or Onion Rings because I wanted to make sure I had enough room to finish this monster burger.\n\nThe waitress was very friendly and the service was good.  It didn't take long for my burger to come out.\n\nI immediately attacked it and pulled an Adam Richman.....I ate as fast as I could to avoid my stomach getting full.  I was surprised in that I never had to stop....I annihilated the burger in less than 10 min.  Besides the occasional pause to add mustard, I didn't have to catch my breath.  It was easier than I expected.\n\nWith the challenge completed, the waitress took a picture of me for the wall....there was another customer who completed the challenge in the restaurant, so he got his picture taken as well.\n\nThe burger itself tasted ok....it wasn't anything great.  Maybe I ate it too fast and didn't get a chance to savor the flavor....I don't know.\n\nWill I return?  Yes, to give a regular burger, fries, onion rings, and shake a try.",

I was at a BBQ earlier in the day and since I completed the challenge last month, I didn't feel compelled to do it again.\n\nSo, I decided I would give the Milkshake & Onion Rings a try.  I ordered an Oreo Cheesecake & Peanut Butter Milkshake and a Small order of Onion Rings.  The Milkshake was good, but it was too runny.  I like thick Shakes.  The Onion Rings were very thin and very, very greasy....didn't have much flavor either.....very bland.  Despite ordering the Creamy Jalapeno Sauce to go along with the Onion Rings, it didn't help it much.\n\nOverall, I had a good time with fellow Yelpers at the UYE, but the food was eh.\n\nWill I return?  Probably not....there are too many burger joints in town and this one is kind of far from my house.",

I've been here several times over the past few years and I always see a celebrity while dining.  Gawking is not cool, so if you're easily impressed with that kind of stuff, save the jaw dropping and drooling for the casino floor and nightclub.....this is not for rookies.\n\nNow, about the food.....it's very, very good.  Some of the dishes I've had over the last few visits:\n\nFarm Fresh Omelet (Mushrooms, Bell Peppers, Onions, Cheese, Ham, Spinach, $13)\nBlack Angus Burger ($15)\nGrilled Cheese Sandwich w/Bacon ($14)\nMargherita Pizza ($14)\n\nThe Grilled Cheese is excellent!  My favorite Grilled Cheese Sandwich in Vegas.  The Burger is solid.  When I feel like having breakfast at lunch, I'll go for the Omelet.....it never disappoints.\n\nThe atmosphere is trendy and the large glass windows facing the pool allow a ton of natural lighting to come in and set a unique mood that you can't find in Vegas very often.\n\nOverall, it's one of my favorite places in Vegas.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

The seating area in the C Gate area can also get very busy.....the seating at the other location is usually open because the customers at the A/B Gate location usually get their food and go to their gate since it's at a fork between the 2 gate areas and there's still a 2-3 minute walk to the actual gate.  Keep that in mind if you're planning to grab a bite before your flight.\n\nThe food is.....well, it's fast food and doesn't taste any different than the locations outside of the airport, just realize the cost is 50% higher.  The service level is decent, not great.\n\nOverall, it's a solid place to grab a quick bite and deserves the 3 Star rating in my book.\n\nReturn Factor - 70%",

There were so many things on the menu that caught our eye.  We decided to go with:\n\nThree different types of Bruschetta:\n- Arrabiata (Spicy Tomatoes, Olives & Garlic), $4\n- Peperonata (Roasted Peppers, Capers & Basil), $4\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=TmZ6hTHPUtcTFDIs3QR3oQ#TmZ6hTHPUtcTFDIs3QR3oQ\n\n- Fagioli (Cannellini Beans, Crispy Prosciutto), $4\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=bYJOjgNiWW6yeWXsy_IXaQ#bYJOjgNiWW6yeWXsy_IXaQ\n\nEntrees:\nFettuccine alla Bolognese (Fettuccine w/Veal and Pork \nShank Ragout), $22\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=wvuSD4YdYIc5r_eENfRE8Q#wvuSD4YdYIc5r_eENfRE8Q\n\nAnatra in Agro-Dolce (Duck Breast, Roasted Baby Vegetables\nwith Sweet & Sour Roasted Duck Leg, Pine Nuts \nSultanas and a Honey Herb Sauce), $27\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=vYEXJIcrxfCh4-cgl5AJlg#vYEXJIcrxfCh4-cgl5AJlg\n\nSide Dish\nRisotto w/Parmesan Cheese & Parsley, $7\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=LHXaImmzdoKPh0qcB9Td5Q#LHXaImmzdoKPh0qcB9Td5Q\n\nDessert\nCreme Brulee\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=pDHJTf0_B-ToAMq8VCuXFA#pDHJTf0_B-ToAMq8VCuXFA\n\nIt sounds like a lot of food, but it wasn't too bad.  The portions are not over the top huge.  Out of the 3 Bruschettas we tried, my favorite was the Fagioli.  It was totally different than anything I've tried before.  The Beans went very well with the Prosciutto and Bread.\n\nThe Fettuccine all Bolognese was awesome....very rich though.  The Veal & Pork Shank Ragout was what made it rich and full of flavor.  I had a bite of The Better Half's Anatra and it was good too.  The side of Risotto went perfectly with our meal.\n\nI was only able to get a small bite out of TBH's Creme Brulee....she doesn't like to share her Dessert, ha!  It was delish....next time, we'll order less Bruschetta so I can get one for myself.\n\nService was outstanding during the entire meal.\n\nReturn Factor - 85%",

The Steak Burrito Especial was even better.  The Steak was juicy and full of flavor.  All of the ingredients were fresh and complimented each other.

Only one person in line ahead of me, 4 employees doing nothing, I waited 5 minutes, got frustrated, and left.  Why 4 employees would waste people's time like that is beyond me.\n\nInstead I went to a Burrito place and overpaid for a boatload of calories I didn't need.\n\nWill I return?  I might have caught them on an off day, so I will try to come here again next time.  For now, 2 Stars.",

    "text": "Stopped by for lunch with a fellow Yelper the other day.  Heard this was an organic healthy, Vegan & Vegetarian hangout.....that also served the Carnivores, so I was eager to give it a try and see what it feels like to be a Vegan in a Steakhouse (since I'm a Carnivore).  \n\nThis was one of the most difficult reviews for me to write.  This place has so much potential.....I wish there was a 1/2 Star system because I want to give it 3.5 Stars and was on the fence for 3 or 4 Stars, here's why:\n\nThe menu is pretty extensive and has a lot of items that pique'd my interest, such as: Grilled Chicken Soft Tacos ($12.95), Buffalo Chicken Wrap ($7.99), Pepperoni Pizzetta ($8.95)....wait, what's a Pizzetta?  Turns out it's a Pizza.....come on, enough with the goofy names already, just call it a Pizza and call it a day!  A lot of stuff looked good and I was surprised at the number of items available for Carnivores....I ended up ordering their Fire Fries (Baked Fries topped with Hot Sauce, Pico de Gallo, Mozzarella & Cheddar Cheese $7) and a Chicken Panini (w/Buffalo Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil with Pesto $7.95).  The server asked if I wanted the Vegan Cheese on the Fire Fries....I passed and wanted the full monty.\n\nTo wash it down, I had some Iced Tea ($2.50)....which was awesome BTW.\n\nThe service was a bit slow.  It took some time for the waiter to take our order and the table next to us had to stop a busperson to get their order taken too.  It was 11:30 am and the lunch rush hadn't started yet, so I don't know what the issue was.  Anyway, it wasn't too bad but was borderline annoying.....another few minutes and it would have cost them a Star.\n\nOur food came out after a short wait and I was surprised to see how HUGE the Fire Fries were!  I thought this was suppose to be a \"healthy\" restaurant?!  LOL  For a minute I thought I was in Claim Jumper!  The Fries look too good, so I attacked them first.  The top layer of Fire Fries were awesome....baked well and had good flavor.  However.....the middle and bottom portion of the Fries were undercooked and semi-raw, not good.  Also, the cook didn't spread the ingredients throughout the dish.....the Hot Sauce and Pico de Gallo was only in one corner of the dish, buried under the top layer of Cheese.  The other 3/4 of the dish was only melted Cheese and the Fries.  This was a damn shame because the portion with all of the ingredients was awesome!  The rest of it was just so/so.  He/she needs a lesson in making a consistent dish.\n\nThe Chicken Panini was next.....after I took one bite I realized I made a big mistake.  The combination of Fire Fries and the Chicken Panini wasn't good.  The sharp, spicy flavor of the Fire Fries overwhelmed my taste buds so when I ate my Chicken Panini it tasted bland.  This is not the restaurant's fault, but mine.  So my review of the Panini is incomplete.  The side Salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette was awesome though.  \n\nAnother note....the Panini came with Whole Grain Bread as a default....I wasn't given an option for any other type of Bread, but saw other people with Panini's with what appeared to be White Bread....wish I had the choice.\n\nOverall, this place has a lot of potential.  That's what made it so difficult for me to rate it....the 1/4 of the Fries that had all of the ingredients and were cooked thoroughly tasted awesome but the raw Potatoes in the middle was a turn off.  For now they get 4 Stars for their Vegan/Vegetarian menu options and the potential of their Fire Fries.\n\nWill I return?  I will someday to try a couple more items that intrigued me.",

    "text": "It's been at least 5 or 6 years since the last time I visited this joint.  I worked at the Eldorado Casino back in the mid 90's and this place use to have decent food......that was back when it was named \"Cactus Joe's\".  It's really gone downhill since those days.\n\nI happened to be in the area and stopped by for lunch with my Mom.  I ordered the Nachos w/o Meat and Mom ordered the Fish & Chips special.\n\nAfter a short wait we were served our food.  I was disappointed to see that the Nachos were Chips, Cheese Whiz, Tomatoes, Onions on a plate with a small bowl of Beans, cup of Guacamole, cup of Salsa, and two packages of Sour Cream on the side......what the ___?  Was I suppose to create this thing myself?  Where did it say that on the menu?  I know why they did it.....to save money.  There's less food waste when you do stuff like that, but seriously?\n\nAs a fan of Nachos it was a huge letdown.....plus they didn't taste good at all.  The Chips weren't fresh and the flavors were just strange.....unappealing.\n\nMom enjoyed her Fish & Chips, which were really Fish & Fries.  She liked her Fish and I tried a few Fries...they weren't bad.  Maybe I ordered the wrong item?\n\nOverall, the service was good and since Mom enjoyed her dish I'm giving this place 2 Stars instead of 1.\n\nWill I return?  Someday I probably will for the sake of nostalgia....but I predict it won't happen any time soon.",

    "text": "We had a couple of Deal Chicken coupons for this joint, so we came on back to back Sundays to redeem.  This was the first time I dined in.  Normally, we order delivery.  I can tell you that dining in is a very good experience.  The server remembered us from the week before and greeted us with a warm hello and smile.  Her name is Ashley and she's awesome.  She made sure we were well taken care of and that our drink glasses were always full.\n\nAnother standout  employee is one of the cooks.  I didn't get his name, but he took the Pizza out of the oven and brought it to our table before he cut it to make sure it was cooked to our desired crispiness.  We like our Pizza well-done and he wouldn't slice it up until we gave him the thumbs up.  Both visits we didn't have to send it back, they got the crispiness done properly the first time.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nFamily sized Brooklyn Family Pizza (Pepperoni, Sausage, Basil), $21.49\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=Q61H5MQsP_7pOjeVF_DwFg#Q61H5MQsP_7pOjeVF_DwFg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=prumSXcrD0Eozq3Rx7pWVQ#prumSXcrD0Eozq3Rx7pWVQ\n\nFamily sized Mott Street Meat Lover Pizza (Pepperoni, Sausage, Meatball), $21.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=63hD4U7PKOLnonxA--8XAQ#63hD4U7PKOLnonxA--8XAQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=pO92ZpZdDaN1LGtSCi_KnA#pO92ZpZdDaN1LGtSCi_KnA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=XdIo9EZWyEgtcCQmqmI_gg#XdIo9EZWyEgtcCQmqmI_gg\n\nChicken Wings, $8.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=Zc5dliKkTzXw1arLmXSf-w#Zc5dliKkTzXw1arLmXSf-w\n\nGarlic Cheese Knots, $4.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=uW_tFc4M2RIs8KG6QWS2FA#uW_tFc4M2RIs8KG6QWS2FA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=5p3iujrt6uR9OkTX51GZRQ#5p3iujrt6uR9OkTX51GZRQ\n\nEverything was good.  The Pizza is awesome of course.  I'm a huge fan of their Pizza.  The Wings are OK, not great.  The Garlic Cheese Knots are outstanding, which surprised me.  They're not really \"knots\", but more like a fluffy dinner roll covered with Melted Cheese, Butter, and Garlic....pure heaven!  Once you have one, you can't stop eating them.\n\nOverall, the dine-in experience was awesome.  I highly recommend giving it a try if you like Pizza and are in the area.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

After browsing the menu, I decided to try:\n4 oz BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich, $4.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z8Em-bhZI3Mmspml7tj6tg?select=Erry3muhVFQdFZQPCJRHzw\n2 oz Hot Link Sandwich, $3\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z8Em-bhZI3Mmspml7tj6tg?select=qxTdcqqimxhFcmoW1Iyj9g\nI got them both \"dressed\", which means they give you Onions & Pickles on the side to put on the Sandwich.\n\nNext to the Soda Fountain, there are vats of Hot & Mild BBQ Sauce for self service.  I of course went for the Hot BBQ Sauce.\n\nThe food is delivered to your table when it's ready.  I went for the Hot Link Sandwich first and didn't put any Hot BBQ Sauce on it so that I could taste the natural Spiciness of the Hot Link.....well, I was disappointed, it's not very hot at all.  Damn, the search for real BBQ Hot Link Sandwiches continues.\n\nNext, I went for the BBQ Beef Brisket Sammie.....I poured some Hot BBQ Sauce and added the Onions & Pickles to it.  It's not a bad Sandwich.....pretty good.  I thought the Bread was a bit blah....like grocery store Bread......a nice Italian or French Roll would have been better with it.  The Beef was tender and juicy and had a slightly smoky flavor to it.  I prefer it to have a bit more flavor to it, but like how they serve you the Sandwich dry and allow you to put your own BBQ Sauce on it.\n\nThe Hot BBQ Sauce was pretty spicy......really enjoyed that a lot.\n\nOverall, it was a pretty good experience.\n\nReturn Factor - 71%",

The next bite I tried the Mustard BBQ sauce...that one had some good flavor to it and added to the meal, so I used it for the remainder of the meal.  The Big Dad comes with Texas Toast as the bread for the Sandwich and it helped hold it together well.  Overall, it was average.\n\nThe Cole Slaw I ordered for my side was ok...not as creamy as I prefer, but it was ok.\n\nI'm a fan of BBQ and this place didn't leave me wanting more, thus the average 3 Star rating.\n\nReturn Factor - 30%",

My friends and I love BWW because of the FREE Wireless Internet.   it allows us to work while we play.\n\nIt only gets 3 Stars in my book because the food is ok....nothing special.  Also, their beer is so/so.  The last visit I had their Wheat Beer and it was kind of blah...not much flavor to it.  I switched it up to Blue Moon after one glass.  i can get Blue Moon anywhere else.\n\nThey get bonus points for their service at this location...it was pretty solid.  However, the tables in the bar area were pretty nasty.  There was a huge layer of \"gunk\" on the table we were sitting at....so bad that the napkin under my beer stuck to the table.  It was gross.  They lost 1 Star because of that.\n\nWill I return?  Yeah, because I have friends who like this location.  There are better locations in town.",

I come here because a friend of mine comes here regularly, but I wouldn't come to this BWW otherwise.\n\nMy last visit was this past Thursday evening.  I was waiting for my friend in the bar and wanted to order a Ranger IPA.  I was told they didn't carry IPA on tap or bottled.....WTH?  The other location on North Durango & 215 has two IPA's on tap.....I was there 2 weeks ago, so I know they carry it.  I asked the waiter if they recently stopped selling IPA's and he said he didn't know and didn't even know what an IPA beer was!  I settled on a 24 oz Newcastle and put away 4 or 5 before the night was over.\n\nWow, I thought that BWW's were suppose to be consistent with their product.  I guess I was wrong.....whatever.\n\nWill I come back?  Only when I come to visit my friend, otherwise I wouldn't come to this location.  There are better BWW's in Vegas.",

I ordered American Cheese ($.75) on one and Pepper Jack ($.75) on the other.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AL5YzikrmxwcBzBNLGO7Jw?select=Fctoo65ZB1jpFxM1_zpamg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AL5YzikrmxwcBzBNLGO7Jw?select=_PZGFceSYTI1jygSRi5N6A\n\nOne of the things I love about Fuddrucker's is the fresh toppings bar where you can load up whatever you want on your Burger.  I decided to put Onions, Jalapenos, Mayo, and Mustard.  I also got some melted Jalapeno Cheddar Cheese for dipping my Fries.\n\nThe Burgers were tasty of course and the Fries were perfect!  The combo came with a Soda and I went with Coke Zero.....I'm not a Soda drinker, but I think I'm becoming addicted to Coke Zero.....have to stop that soon.\n\nOverall, it was another great meal @ Fuddrucker's!\n\nReturn Factor - 93.5%",

The restaurant came highly recommended by a friend, and we noticed that they had Foie Gras on the menu (her fave) so we decided to check it out.  \n\nWe reviewed the menu before we got to the restaurant and decided to order:\n\nRoasted Foie Gras Prepared Sous Vide - $110 \nSmoked Truffle-Infused Filet Mignon - $38\n\nFor sides - $8 each:\n\nMac n' Cheese au Gratin w/ Ham\nGnocchi\nPotatoes Au Gratin\n\nThe server took the order and came back a few minutes later to tell us that they're out of Foie Gras.  We were extremely disappointed and surprised....especially since there were 3 items on the menu that had Foie Gras as the main ingredient and the place wasn't packed.  \n\nIn an attempt to save the day, the server checked with the kitchen and came back and said there was a small piece of Foie Gras left for the Appetizer but that he could prepare it like the entree.  Since we came all the way down here for the dish, we agreed.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our dinner, our Bread and Water was never refilled and we had to pour our own Wine.  For a restaurant like this, we didn't expect that kind of service.\n\nThe food arrived...the Filet was decent, but not great.  Not as tender as I usually like it.  The highlight was the Gnocchi.  The Better Half said her Foie Gras tasted a little funny.  She didn't finish her serving.\n\nOverall, the experience was sub-par.  The server's attempt to save the day kept us from giving this place 1 Star.\n\nReturn Factor - 5%",

We order it \"well done\", but with it being so loaded, it's not as crispy as I'd like....but that's ok, we knew it would be tough with all of those toppings.  The toppings are fresh and tasty and the Dough is yummy!\n\nService here is good, we've had a couple of great servers.\n\nReturn Factor - 88%",

We go and enjoy a glass of wine or two...or three.\n\nFood - The food is very good and goes well with their selection of wine.  We usually get a cheese plate or a salad.  We normally don't eat a full blown meal here.  We are here for the wine more than the food.\n\nWine - There is a good selection of wine to choose from and all of the staff are knowledgeable and can help you find one that suits your taste.\n\nService - The service is outstanding.  They go over and above to ensure you have a good experience.  Stop by and say hello to Max.\n\nAtmosphere - This is our favorite part of Grape Vegas.  The bar & inside seating is very comfortable and chic.  Outdoor seating is an option as well....which is rare in Vegas.  It's located next to the Rave Movie Theaters, so it's a great place to hang out while your kids are at the movies....*hint*\n\nWill I return?  If the 5 Star rating wasn't a clue....of course!",

The Beef was of high quality and full of flavor.  Just the right portion size too.  Next I had the Veggie Calzone....I have to admit, I was a little skeptical of that part of the dish, but they delivered....it was awesome.  The best part of the dish though was the Potato Salad w/Bacon.....that's right folks, it has BACON in it!!!  It tastes as good as it sounds.  The Bacon does not overwhelm the flavor of the Potato Salad, it compliments it.  It also has very sharp flavors and rounds out the trio dish well.  Well done chef, well done!\n\nI can't wait until our next lunch downtown!\n\nReturn Factor - 95%",

Here's my Son and I had on our first visit:\n\nCarnitas de Jalisco, $9.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=hs9izE2KQH42bIhX2k2tPw#hs9izE2KQH42bIhX2k2tPw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=873KJQLaeB5FKuPMB3jC8Q#873KJQLaeB5FKuPMB3jC8Q\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=yewf-V6M-eviSlnMFN_klg#yewf-V6M-eviSlnMFN_klg\n\nBuenos Nachos w/Ground Beef, $6.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=ZLUrrPL1RDSqhkQvkzRmtw#ZLUrrPL1RDSqhkQvkzRmtw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=yi__pt7IXqW10j9yHcOFPA#yi__pt7IXqW10j9yHcOFPA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=aOWIlXAmRLOPY72He5rTfw#aOWIlXAmRLOPY72He5rTfw\n\nCarne Asada Taco, $2.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=8LpgSd1OL903W82t13JOrQ#8LpgSd1OL903W82t13JOrQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=u38XVbgVvK3uG9jgrPQjdA#u38XVbgVvK3uG9jgrPQjdA\n\nMy Son ordered the Carnitas and I asked him for a few bites so I could sample the plate...it was very good, nice flavor.  Beans and Rice complimented it well.\n\nI had the Nachos and the Carne Asada Taco.  The Nachos were awesome....the did a great job with this dish.  It's Spicy and has a ton of flavor....portion size is big too.  They serve it on a Pizza dish....I think that's the trend now as this is at least the 2nd or 3rd place I've seen Nachos served on a Pizza dish.  Before moving to the Scottsdale area, I'd never seen that.  Back to the food....\n\nThe Carne Asada Taco was OK...it was the only dish that disappointed.  They do something different here with it....they add Lettuce....a lot of Lettuce....too much Lettuce (see pics above).  I think the Lettuce overwhelmed the flavor of the Taco....if I order this again, I will either order it without the Lettuce or take it off before I eat it.\n\nThe service here is good too.  We asked for very Spicy Salsa instead of the normal one they give you with your dish and they came back with a Habanero based Salsa....it had a serious kick to it.  It was nice to have that option.\n\nReturn Factor - 92%",

On this last visit, I ordered a 6\" Italian Sub.\n\nYou order the Sandwich from the cashier and you receive a number, then a server brings out the order to your table.  Very convenient.  Since it's located next to the SuperBook, there are plenty of Plasma TVs with sporting events and horse racing to keep you distracted while you wait for your food.  There's also a ton of seating, so you'll be sure to find a place to sit unlike many of the sportsbook delis in Vegas.\n\nAfter a short wait our food was ready.  The Meat & toppings were fresh.  This Deli advertises that they use Boar's Head Deli Meats, so that's always a plus....I love Boar's Head products.  Although it was only a 6\" Sandwich, it was very filling.\n\nOverall, great experience & great service.\n\nWill I return?  Of course!",

The Teriyaki Sauce they are glazed are sweet and have the right amount of \"sour\" kick to it to balance the flavor.  The Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus is awesome...the Filet is tender and juicy and the Asparagus compliments it well.  Of course, the Chocolate Cake dessert is a nice ending for the meal.\n\nThe service can be a bit slow at times, depends on the server.

This evening, I opted for Pizza, Macaroni & Cheese, Fried Chicken, Hot Link Sausage, and for dessert a Slice of Blueberry Pie.\n\nThe food is pretty good.  My favorite is the Fried Chicken and Mac n Cheese.  The Chicken has a nice, crispy & flaky skin to it with the white meat tender and juicy in the inside.  The Mac n Cheese is thick and gooey....nom nom!\n\nSince it was dinner, they had the small bar open, so I had some Oktoberfest Beer to wash it all down....this was complimentary, bonus!\n\nOverall, we had a good dinner with great service.\n\nWill I return?  Sure.",

Boy was I disappointed!  Here's what I ordered:\n\nCarne Asada Taco, $3.25\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/polibertos-phoenix?select=T9aXK2Wj3MhupooxqD_k4Q#T9aXK2Wj3MhupooxqD_k4Q\n\nCarnitas Taco, $2.65\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/polibertos-phoenix?select=GamyRxhVKMb4tbQR-ss9jw#GamyRxhVKMb4tbQR-ss9jw\n\nBeans, Rice, Cheese Burrito, $2.99 + $.065 (Rice)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/polibertos-phoenix?select=ZOK8OWJR0DTI8bC0-kfSYw#ZOK8OWJR0DTI8bC0-kfSYw\n\nThe portion size is very large, so you get your money's worth as far as quantity, but the quality was terrible.\n\nI tried the Carnitas Taco first....took one bite and immediately didn't like it.  Why?  The Carnitas was \"rubbery\" and lacked flavor...it was bland.  It was so gross, I only took 2 bites hoping the 2nd would be better (it wasn't), so I didn't finish it.\n\nNext was the Carne Asada Taco....took one bite and was underwhelmed.  The Steak had a lot of fat and was \"chewy\".  It also didn't taste good to me and I didn't finish that either.\n\nLast was the Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito.  I was hoping it would salvage my meal, but sadly it didn't.  It was very salty and the Beans tasted like they'd been sitting around for a while.  It didn't taste fresh.  The saltiness was very hard to overcome and I also didn't finish that portion.\n\nI threw way 1/2 of my meal....that's why I gave this place 2 Stars.  It was the worst I've had since moving to the Phoenix area.\n\nReturn Factor - 5%",

I took one bite and became a fan!  The quality of the ingredients was evident...the Tacos were delish.\n\nService was  pretty good as well.

It was a Friday around 2 pm and the place was dead when I arrived.  I think there were 2 tables of people and a couple sitting at the bar.  I saddled up to one of the high top tables near the bar.  When they arrived, we decided to order food:\n\nCauliflower Calabrese, $7.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hannys-phoenix-2?select=AynlqEIqWzqroBIohHdBtQ#AynlqEIqWzqroBIohHdBtQ\n\nPepperoni & Onion Pizza, $12\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hannys-phoenix-2?select=TfcOk88mLctj7An6P8Ujfg#TfcOk88mLctj7An6P8Ujfg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hannys-phoenix-2?select=5WP8r8BiTWxe41rLzqkN3w#5WP8r8BiTWxe41rLzqkN3w\n\nPanino (Prosciutto di Parma, Sopressata, Fontina Cheese, Arugula, Ciabatta Bread, Italian Vinaigrette), $10.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hannys-phoenix-2?select=Y1LbrCWk_0N8P3lKl-FGTA#Y1LbrCWk_0N8P3lKl-FGTA\n\nStrawberry Longcake\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hannys-phoenix-2?select=liJrOPp-ecTBfmXZeweMrA#liJrOPp-ecTBfmXZeweMrA\n\nThe Cauliflower Calabrese was very interesting....it was like a stir fry dish.  The Cauliflower was pretty good and flavorful...I like the texture of it.  The rest of it was *meh*.\n\nThe Pepperoni Pizza was pretty good.  It's very thin and while the portion looks large, it's not too bad if 1 person had it as their entree.  We split it up.\n\nOne of my clients had the Panino.  She said it was very good.\n\nWe all tried the Strawberry Longcake...which is divine!  It's a Strawberry Cake fused with Ice Cream and Strawberries and topped with Strawberry Drizzle, fresh Strawberries, and Whipped Cream.  Wow, this surprised us and blew us away.  What a nice surprise!\n\nOverall, it's a pretty cool joint.  I hear they have DJ's on the weekend and it turns into a pretty cool spot.  We'll have to come back and try that sometime.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

Also, I'd recommend asking for a free standing table instead of the bench seated \"community\" tables because those tables are pretty close together and you won't have any privacy.\n\nSome menu items we've ordered are:\n\nVesuvius Burger, $12.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/indulge-burgers-and-more-scottsdale?select=jJ909hC-XqZDXPv-1kFXow#jJ909hC-XqZDXPv-1kFXow\n\nChicken Wings, $8.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/indulge-burgers-and-more-scottsdale?select=OrF_EvFDVGxE3ddqKtGXyw#OrF_EvFDVGxE3ddqKtGXyw\n\n1/2 Fries, 1/2 Onion Strings, $5\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/indulge-burgers-and-more-scottsdale?select=6y07slzhlZ4zTfxvR2QXkQ#6y07slzhlZ4zTfxvR2QXkQ\n\nSliders, $7.95 for 2....$3.50 for ea extra\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/indulge-burgers-and-more-scottsdale?select=12gc2N1b90utvafur4OwZg#12gc2N1b90utvafur4OwZg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/indulge-burgers-and-more-scottsdale?select=Jw8uFL4H3eNqSAclbCitbg#Jw8uFL4H3eNqSAclbCitbg\n\nCheeseburger, $9.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/indulge-burgers-and-more-scottsdale?select=YJWvGjFTpcofzXnLakslNQ#YJWvGjFTpcofzXnLakslNQ\n\nSonoran Burger, $13.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/indulge-burgers-and-more-scottsdale?select=3D5FpjhS4PIZ91D5e7u63g#3D5FpjhS4PIZ91D5e7u63g\n\nTurkey Burger, $9.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/indulge-burgers-and-more-scottsdale?select=BYH2HY6p7wKgo49a3LX24A#BYH2HY6p7wKgo49a3LX24A\n\nBy far, the best items on the menu are the Sonoran Burger, Vesuvius Burger, and the Wings.  A Vesuvius Burger is two patties of Beef stuffed with the Cheese inbetween the 2 so that the Cheese gets cooked/melted in the middle.  A Sonoran Burger is the same as a Vesuvius with the addition of Peanut Butter on top.....and that's what makes it so good, yum!  You have to be careful on your first bite though because the Cheese is piping hot and it will burn the hell out of your mouth!\n\nThe Wings are a suprise....they're pretty good, above average.\n\nThe rest of the menu are specialty Burgers or  you can create your own with select toppings, etc.  It's a pretty cool setup.\n\nThe servers are usually pretty friendly and attentive.  However, when they get really busy, service will slow down a bit.\n\nReturn Factor - 85%",

My two favorite apps to order are:\n\nCheese Curds\nPretzel\n\nThe Cheese Curds are especially good....you can't find them in very many places and the few that have it aren't as good as this place.

Same for the Crispy Caramel Chicken.  Neither one blew me away and made me want more.\n\nThe service here is always hit or miss.  They get really busy and the place is huge, so it's easy for you to get lost.  During this visit, I forgot to ask my server for Thousand Island Dressing for the Sliders....it took me a while to find him and flag him down because he was serving tables on the other side of the huge dining room, so it wasn't easy for him to glance over to our table to see us waving at him.  Finally, another server asked what we needed and she helped us out....oye!\n\nReturn Factor - 60%",

    "text": "During a recent Vegas trip, I was hungry for breakfast and decided to head over to the Grand Luxe Cafe at the Palazzo to grab a bite.  I was hungry for Waffles, so I knew what I wanted ahead of time.  However, after browsing the menu, I decided to add an order of Beignets as well.  When I think of Beignets, I think of the light, powdered sugar Doughnuts in New Orleans.  I was in for a big surprise when the server brought out the order....\n\nBeignets, $7.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=k3qwl979nu3K0smXiMGhNg#k3qwl979nu3K0smXiMGhNg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=SrtObgQ_8dSJKMBfZopbFA#SrtObgQ_8dSJKMBfZopbFA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=Xxth4L2hZfG1WhlCh8yVZw#Xxth4L2hZfG1WhlCh8yVZw\n\nBelgian Waffle, $8.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=aye9-4Y9ypMy4uSgu5_pFw#aye9-4Y9ypMy4uSgu5_pFw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=HxHvL4-uNZryft320GOUmQ#HxHvL4-uNZryft320GOUmQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=gIQX6_qfBQv6c7bA0OH6FA#gIQX6_qfBQv6c7bA0OH6FA\n\nCoffee, $3.95\n\nThe Beignets is actually a bowl of 10+ Doughnuts that are encrusted with Sugar....they're very good, but heavier and more rich than the type they serve at Cafe du Monde (New Orleans).  After having one of these, I decided to eat my Waffle first, so I could satisfy that urge.  The Waffle was very good.  After that, I was only able to eat 3 more Beignets before I had to cry uncle and give up....it was too much for me to handle by myself....LOL  They were tasty, just too large of a portion.  \n\nThe Coffee didn't help balance the sweet taste of my breakfast.  It wasn't worth $3.95....it was actually terrible and tasted like Folgers...yuck.  Save your money and buy Coffee elsewhere.\n\nOverall, the breakfast was pretty good.  I like it better than lunch and dinner menu items here.....so I'm raising it to 4 Stars from 3 for that.  Next time, I will bring my Wife or a guest to help with the Beignets.\n\nReturn Factor - 75% (breakfast only)",

We've come in for Breakfast & Lunch.  More recently, Lunch, to avoid the long lines during the Breakfast hours.  Here's a tip, if you show up after 12 pm you'll be better off than before then to find a table.  This tip applies to Sundays, which is the day we prefer to go.\n\nHere are some of the items I've had here:\n\nThe Basic (2 Eggs, Bacon, Hash Browns, Buttermilk Pancakes) - $7.99\nBreakfast Burrito (Scrambled Eggs, Sausage, Onions, Green Peppers, Cheddar Cheese) - $6.99\nWestern Burger (Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, Onion Rings, and BBQ sauce) - $10.99\nSack of 10 Angus Sliders - $12.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5Ip4_yFvx3sz4qMqxl-4mw?select=mVXqbkwPFs19EnACRXJANA#mVXqbkwPFs19EnACRXJANA\n\nMy favorite is the Sack of 10 Sliders.  They're very good and you can take a few home for later!  The staff is friendly, but sometimes the food order can take a while. \n\nI hope they continue to do Groupon, because the deal is totally worth it here.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

    "text": "Was driving around the area and decided that I would stop by a place I've never been to before and found this little place in the same shopping mall as BWW.  It was around 2 pm and there were only two tables occupied in the joint.  A lady behind the counter asked if I was dining in or out.  When I told her I was dining in, she handed me a menu and told me I could sit anywhere in the restaurant.\n\nAfter browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided on the Italian Sub (Ham, Capricole, Genoa Salami, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, and Provolone Cheese) $10.50....came with Fries, Cole Slaw, and Pickle.  I also ordered a side of Jalapenos, in case I wanted to add some kick to it.\n\nWhile I waited for my food, I looked around the joint.  There are beverage coolers in the front of the Deli that had Sodas & Bottled Water.  I was tempted to buy a bottle of Dr. Browns Natural Soda, but after reading the label I decided against it because it said \"Sugar/High Fructose Corn Syrup\".....how is that \"natural\"?  I'm trying to avoid HFCS, so I passed and got a bottle of Water.  They also have Bagels & Pastries available for purchase.....they looked tempting (see pics), but I wanted to wait until after I had my Sandwich to decide if I would do Dessert.\n\nAfter a few minutes my Sandwich came out.  The thing was piled high with Meat!  (see pics) I wasn't expecting this....I had to remove some of it before I ate the Sandwich, just so I could take a bite.  After a few bites, I realized that it was a pretty dry Sandwich.....so I asked for Mayo & Mustard.  I added a little of both and it still lacked something....so I took the Cole Slaw and put it in the Sandwich....ahh, much better!  The Sandwich by itself was too dry and lacked the flavor of really good Italian Sandwiches....at least to me.\n\nThe Fries were pre-fab Crinkle Fries.....pretty bland, had to add Salt.  They weren't that good.  The Cole Slaw very excellent, not too runny or sweet and had a nice crunch to it, which I like.  The Pickle was eh....I've had better.\n\nOverall, it was a OK experience.  There are a bunch of other Sammies on the menu I want to try, so for now it gets 3 Stars from me.\n\nWill I return?  I probably will, but I'm not craving the joint.",

This was the third one.\n\nMy Son and his friend wanted to get some Pizza before the UNLV Football game on Saturday.  Since this location was on the way to the Stadium, we stopped here for lunch.  AYCE Pizza Buffet priced at $3.99 per person is pretty good....don't you think?\n\nThis Cici's looks relatively new and is very clean.  It was a Saturday afternoon around 3 pm and it was packed!  However, it didn't stop them from pumping out Pizza after Pizza to keep everyone happy.  The boys and I went for plate after plate of Pizza.....until we couldn't eat another slice.  That held us over until we got to the Tailgate Party...ha!\n\nOverall, great spot.....service was awesome.  They kept the Pizza Buffet full of Pizza with over 100 people in the restaurant.....amazing!\n\nWill I return?  It's very far from my house, but next time I'm in the neighborhood....probably.",

It's a fun night to people watch.\n\nTucked away in the City North development, the location is less than ideal to drive a lot of traffic.  So, it takes a lot of work to get people out here on a regular.  On Wed nights, they do a great job of doing that.\n\nThe place gets packed and you have to get there early or make reservations to snag one of the comfortable, padded chairs/table setups on the 2nd level with a great view of the band/dance floor.\n\nThe party atmosphere on Wednesdays is pretty cool, especially for Phoenix which is typically dead all of the time.  A mid-week party like this is rare.\n\nWe've dined here a few times.  The Margherita Flatbread and Burger are both pretty good.  The food isn't why we come here though, so it's always an afterthought for us.\n\nThe staff here is really attractive and can keep up with the pace of a nightclub atmosphere, so the service levels have always been high for us.\n\nOverall, a fun night out.

I think it's one of the newer locations in town.\n\nThe service was pretty good, our server made sure our iced teas were kept full.\n\nSince it was a business lunch, I decided not to pig out and went for the Kobe Cheeseburger Sliders.  Normally, I would get a pizza and some appetizers, but I didn't have my wife, son, and mother to back me up and help me out with the chow....so, sliders it was.\n\nThey were cooked to my liking and I love how they are topped with Gorgonzola & Cheddar Cheese.....yum!  The only bad thing is that I really didn't want fries and I'm not a fan of Cole Slaw....but there was no substitutes, so I went with the fries....there went the diet!  I asked about a side salad and the server said the only size of side salad they had could feed 2 people!  What the hell?!  I hope they change that somewhere down the road because I can't pig out like that on business lunches.\n\nIn any case, the lunch was enjoyable.\n\nWill I return?  You bet your Sammy's I will!",

They were all delicious.  However, the Sliders were a little overcooked and the goat cheese didn't have as sharp of a flavor as we would hope.\n\nService - Our server, Nicolle, was very helpful and personable.  She ensured that our glasses stayed full and that we were taken care of.\n\nAtmosphere - This place is a bar/tavern.  There is a pool table & video games available.  There is also a nice sized patio, which i is where we ate tonight.....the weather was perfect.\n\nWill we come back?  Yes.",

The slices were huge!  It was almost the size of a small Pizza!  I thought that the Pizza was awful, the sauce tasted like canned sauce, the Cheese was flavorless, and I thought the crust was undercooked and rubbery, Strikes 2, 3, 4.  Since I was starving I ate it anyway, except I didn't eat the crust....which is rare for me, I always eat the crust....it was that bad.\n\nI know this place is a chain so I'm not sure I will ever try it again....not my type of place.  I prefer better quality pizza.\n\nWill I return?  No way!",

They were very tasty.  The chips tasted fresh, as if they were made in the kitchen.  The only problem with the dish is that they put too much of the toppings on it.  It was very soggy at the bottom of the dish.  The portion size is huge.  For an appetizer, it can feed at least 3 to 4 people.  For an entree, it's a lot to put down.....needless to say, I didn't finish it.\n\nService - The server was friendly and was quick on the draw for drinks....however, he was MIA during the lunch and took a while to bring the check.  The busperson refilled my friend's water, but oddly enough didn't offer to fill my Iced Tea.....I only had 1 glass.....rare for a 1.5 lunch.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience.  We had a table overlooking the pool (see my pics).  The atmosphere for a Cafe in Vegas is the best, hands down.\n\nWill I return?  Next time I'm in this part of Clark County, sure.",

    "text": "This was a classic experience where Less Is More could have been employed to make it better.  After passing by this joint many times, my Mom and I stopped by for lunch on Sunday.\n\nI ordered the Triple Cheese Burger (Swiss, Cheddar, Provolone) with a side of Thai Slaw.  Mom ordered the Blackened Chicken Sandwich (Cajun Chicken blackened in an iron skillet, topped with onions, peppers and melted jack cheese with a cajun mayo on a ciabatta roll) with a side of Thai Slaw.\n\nHere's the breakdown....the Burger has a lot of potential.  I like to put Cole Slaw on my Burger, so I put some of the Thai Slaw on it.  It was juicy, but there was simply too much Cheese on it.  I couldn't taste the Burger and the Cheese flavors were indistinguishable.  The Thai Slaw has some serious potential too, but it was way too runny.  After the first few bites of the Slaw, the bowl was full of liquid so the rest of the Slaw was 'soupy'.....too much sauce and very, very sweet.  Also, there was a ton of Peanuts in the Slaw.  I don't know if they meant to do that, but it overwhelmed the flavor....also, I expect a Thai Slaw to have some heat in it...their version doesn't.\n\nI had 1/2 of Mom's Blackened Chicken Sandwich....again, they should employ the Less Is More Rule here.  The Sandwich was topped with a bunch of Grilled Onions, then fresh Onions....it was Onion overload!  The Chicken had a good, char-smoked flavor, but was lacking a Spicy Kick that I would expect from a Cajun flavored Chicken.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience....not great, but good.\n\nWill I return?  I probably will to try other items on the menu.",

This location is the closest to our home, so we eat here often.\n\nThe restaurant gets very crowded during peak hours....here's a secret of ours....we like to come at 10 am on Sunday morning for an early lunch.  Why?  Because there is nobody there yet and you get seated right away.\n\nFood - during my most recent visit I had the Milanesa Torta.....it was the first time I've tried a Torta at Lindo and it did not disappoint.  The bread was perfect and the milanesa was cooked perfectly.\n\nWe also enjoy the fresh chips & salsa that also includes bean dip.  Most mexican restaurants don't give you beans with your chips & salsa, but they do!\n\nThe tortillas are made fresh daily....if you don't believe me, you can watch them make it.  They have an action station where a woman prepares fresh tortillas.\n\nService - The employee to customer ratio is very high so your water glass is never too empty and the chips & salsa will be replenished quickly.\n\nWill I return?  Oh yeah!",

Here's a tip.....if you want to come here on a holiday and you don't mind eating lunch early, stop by between 9:30-10:30 am.....it's open and there's no wait to get in.  If you come after 11 am, it will be jam packed.\n\nI ordered the Nachos & Mom ordered the Playa Combo....which is a Chile Relleno & Chicken Taco.  The food came out quickly and of course everything was fresh and delicious.\n\nI love how they have complimentary unlimited Chips & Salsa w/Beans.  The Salsa is spicy, just right and the Chips are homemade.\n\nThis place never disappoints!\n\nHappy Father's Day to all the Dad's out there!\n\n\u00bfVoy a volver? \u00a1Por supuesto!

Located on the 2nd floor above the casino, the buffet is the smallest in size and variety of the seven.  Our expectations were pretty low, so we weren't going to fool ourselves into expecting any pleasant surprises.\n\nAfter browsing the buffet line for a while, I decided to try out the Desserts.  Nothing on the main buffet line looked appealing to me and I wanted to save a little room for the other 4 remaining buffets.  The Desserts were OK.....the Cakes were very dry.  I'm glad I passed on most of the items here.\n\nOverall, it's the lowest rated buffet in the Buffet of Buffets.  Will it fill you up?  Sure.  Will you feel satisfied?  To each their own, in my case, no.  To end on a high note, the employees here are friendly.\n\nReturn Factor - 2%",

My flight was out of gate B-12 and there is a 360 Gourmet Burrito joint that I've spotted here in the past....so I went for it.  There was no line and the menu is pretty large with a lot of options.\n\nThe lady working the register kept asking me for my order even after I told her I needed a few minutes to review the menu.  I decided on a Steak Burrito (Steak, Rice, Beans, Cheese, Lettuce, $6.99) and blurted it out......before I could say anything else, a guy handed me a Burrito....wow, that was fast!  I also ordered a bottle of Water ($2.99) and a bag of Jalapeno Chips ($1.99).\n\nThe Burrito was small....about 1/2 the size of a Chipotle or Q'doba Burrito.....and it is very Bland.  The Beans had no flavor.  Additionally, there's no Salsa on it.....and there is no Salsa Bar.  WTH?  I looked up at the menu and saw that Salsa is $.99 extra.  Dammit, nobody told me this.  Actually, for extra cash you could get Guacomole ($1.25), Sour Cream ($.99), or Salsa ($.99) in your Burrito...or bundle them all together for an additonal $2.99...what?!!  That would have made this tiny Burrito $9.98, no freakin' way!  Glad I didn't see that.\n\nAnyway, it was a complete waste of money and calories.  Save yourself and don't stop here if you're at McCarran Airport.\n\nWill I return?  No!",

Here's what happened....I ordered the following items:\n\nBean, Rice, Cheese Burrito $6.99\nBottle of Diet Pepsi $3.19\n\nSince I had a backpack and other stuff in my hand, I forgot the bottle of Diet Pepsi at the counter after I paid for the meal.  I went to the counter to get settled in a spot to eat and get napkins, utensils, etc.  5 minutes later, they called my number for my Burrito....I was starving, so I started to eat it.  After a few bites, I noticed that I didn't have my soda....where was it?  I looked around, went back to the counter.....the employees looked at me but didn't say anything.  I walked around again looking for it....then I said to the girl cashier \"I think I left my Soda somewhere, have you seen it?\"  She said \"No\" then looked at one of the guys and said something in Spanish to him.  He said, \"Oh, I think I have it.  I found it on the counter\".  I watched as he reached into his backpack and gave it back to me.....WTF?!  I think they do this all the time, watch for people to leave stuff behind and then take it.  The appalling thing is that I was still in the restaurant!  \n\nI didn't say anything to them...it would've done no good anyway.  Once a thief, always a thief.\n\nThat does it for me, I will never eat here again.\n\nReturn Factor - 0%",

All three came out hot and fresh.\n\nNY Style Cheese - This was the best of the 3 slices.  The crust was cooked perfectly and the Cheese & Sauce proportions were perfect.\n\nNY Style Pepperoni - I thought the Pepperoni was undercooked for my tastes....I like it slightly burnt.  It was very oily and was beginning to get soggy.  I wouldn't recommend for delivery.  Flavor was good, not great but good.\n\nSicilian Cheese - The crust was a little dry for my tastes.  The edges of the crust were very hard due to the overall dryness of the dough.  It was my least favorite out of the three.\n\nThe menu had other Italian dishes that looked interesting, the Pizzaghetti Sandwich looks very enticing.\n\nOverall, the Pizza was pretty good, but nowhere near as good as the competitor that was mentioned in the talk board.  This is where I wish there was a 1/2 Star rating system as I would give this place 3.5 Stars.  The NY Style Cheese was a 4 Star in my book, but the other 2 were 3 Stars.\n\nWill I return?  It's in Egypt from where I live, but I might make another trip to try the Pizzaghetti Sandwich.",

    "text": "Came here last night to meetup with a large group of people to watch the USC vs Hawaii game on the patio.  Our group made arrangements to have the patio to ourselves during the game.\n\nI've been here once before and didn't like it, but came here anyway because of the group get together.  The service all night long was atrocious.  Here's the breakdown:\n\nOur server gave my table a menu, but failed to mention that even though it wasn't Happy Hour, you could still order from the Happy Hour menu but pay full price for the items.  After browsing the menu for a minute, I thought I overheard someone at the table next to us order Nachos....I scoured the menu looking for them but didn't find it....so I assumed that I was hearing things and we proceeded to order a Pepperoni Pizza and a Mushroom Lover's Pizza.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our food, our glasses of Wine & Beer went empty....then our Water glasses went empty.  We had to flag down the waitress to fill them up each time.....this went on throughout the night.  They brought out the Pepperoni Pizza and we started to devour it....thinking the Mushroom Pizza was still being prepared, I didn't ask about it at the time.  Meanwhile, a huge plate of Nachos gets delivered to the table next to us....what the hell?!  \n\nThen another table next to us gets Nachos too!  So, I asked our server.....\"Where is Nachos on the menu?\".....she says \"It's on the Happy Hour menu, since it isn't Happy Hour they are $9, do you want to order one?\"....I say \"Well, if we didn't already order a Mushroom Pizza and Pepperoni Pizza, I would have ordered Nachos\".....she says \"What Mushroom Pizza?  All I have is a Pepperoni Pizza for you.\"......now I'm pissed....I told her to put in the order for Mushroom Pizza.  I asked how they knew about the Happy Hour menu and she said that they asked for it.....that's crazy....how are people suppose to know to ask about something they are unaware of?\n\nThe 2nd Pizza came out after a while, but what a disaster for service all night. \n\nThe Pizza was good...not great.  The Pepperoni didn't have enough flavor.  The Mushroom Pizza was far from a \"Mushroom Lovers\" Pizza....very few Mushrooms.  I expected more Mushrooms.  I would have rated the food 3 Stars.\n\nWill I return?  Unfortunately, it looks like our group wants to meet here for games all year long, so if I want to hang out with them, I'll return.  Next time I'll eat before I arrive.",

    "text": "After a really crappy visit to Cadillac Ranch a couple of weeks ago, I stopped by here to watch a college football game with some Alumni friends this past Saturday.  Because they chose this place, I didn't have a say in where to go....but decided to give it another shot.\n\nThe experience was a 180 degree change from the last one.  Even though it wasn't Happy Hour, the server had Happy Hour menus out.....which is great because the items on the HH menu are not on the regular menu....I don't care if I have to pay full price.\n\nI ordered the Jalapeno Poppers and based on the recommendation from the server, I had a Lagunitas IPA to wash it down.  The food came out pretty fast and was very tasty.  The Breading on the Jalapenos were very light....not the heavy stuff you find on most Poppers.  The Peppers varied from being really Spicy to Mild.....which happens often with Jalapenos.  The ones that were Spicy were REALLY Spicy!  But I like that...so +1 there.  I didn't care for the Cheese filling though...which was a Cheddar blend of some kind....I prefer Cream Cheese filling.\n\nThe Lagunitas IPA was very tasty....you could taste the Hops, but it didn't overwhelm the flavor.  It was a mellow IPA in my book.  The server made sure my glass was never empty during the game.\n\nWill I return?  While I don't prefer this place, it's the official spot to watch games for our Alumni Club, so I'll be back soon I'm sure.",

The Chips were fresh and the ingredients tasted very good.  However, one minor problem with the Nachos is that the Beans are buried at the bottom of the dish!  Seriously, check it out:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ?select=t8a_2kWuGFXYzHbB7ZQdZQ\nYou have to eat through all of the layers of Chips, Green Chiles, Salsa, Guacamole, and Sour Cream to get to the Beans!  WTH?!  The Beans are really good too!  By the time I got to them, I was full and didn't have many Chips left to eat them with.  Bummer!  The highlight of the Nachos were the Green Chiles....they are really good and make these Nachos taste great and different from other restaurants.\n\nThe Quesadilla was awesome.  They put Green Chiles in the Quesadilla if you ask for it and believe me, you want them....they are sooo good!  It's what makes this Quesadilla unique and tasty.\n\nOverall, it was a pretty good meal.  Not sure I would drive all the way across town to have it again, but if I am in the area I would consider making a short drive.\n\nReturn Factor - 79%",

It was very oily and was a little bland.  Not what I expected from this dish....looked a little undercooked or the fryer's temperature was too low.\n\nThe Salad and Onion Soup was pretty good.  Onion Soup was full of flavor.\n\nI had the Filet and thought it was a little tough....the flavor was good, but the Filet was not tender like I'm use to.  The Better Half had the Rigatoni and gave me a little to sample.  It was just OK too....the Sausage tasted more like a Kielbasa rather than an Italian Sausage....not what I expected.  The side of Spaghetti was decent, but again nothing spectacular.\n\nThe Cheesecake was very good....nice and fluffy.\n\nThe service was a little spotty.  Our server disappeared for long stretches....which was odd because there were only 3 tables in the entire restaurant with people dining.....what he was doing was beyond me.\n\nOverall, it was an average experience.  Not what we were expecting from a joint like this.  Maybe we caught them on a bad day?\n\nReturn Factor - 40%",

    "text": "My family loves Chef Marc.  He had a restaurant on Tenaya & W Lake Mead Blvd that closed a couple of years ago.  We didn't realize he opened a place on Buffalo & Washington....as soon as I heard that he did, I took the Better Half to dinner here.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised to be greeted by Chef Marc himself at the door.  The place was packed and he offered to have us dine at the sofas in the middle of the restaurant.....we politely declined as we prefer a regular table.  We told him we'd prefer to have a glass of wine while we waited for our table.....we're patient.  My Wife told him that we came here to have his Portobello Mushroom & Organic Spinach appetizer (one of our favorites from the old joint)....he said he'd check to see if he could make it.\n\nWhile we waited, we had a glass of Sangiovese wine....it was pretty good....don't remember any other piece of info as it was suggested by Chef Marc and we ordered based on his recommendation.\n\nAfter a 10 minute wait, we were seated....not too bad for not having reservations.  While I perused the menu, I noticed that the Portobello Mushroom appetizer wasn't on there....I wondered if we would get it.  I ordered a Bufalo Mozzarella Caprese Salad to start with Sweet Potato Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Cream Sauce for an entree.....the Better Half ordered the Escargot Appetizer for her meal counting on the Portobello Mushroom Appetizer to show up.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised to see the Portobello Mushroom Appetizer show up.....it was one of our favorite dishes from his old joint and here it was!  It was just as good as we remembered!  The sauce was rich and creamy and the Organic Spinach was fresh and went well with the entire dish.  A few minutes later the Bufalo Caprese Salad arrived....it was a large portion that could have easily been split between 2 people.  The Mozzarella & Tomatoes were fresh and it was A-1 Grade Goodness!\n\nFor a second glass of wine we ordered a glass of Zinfandel...don't remember the vintage or vineyard.\n\nThe entrees showed up and I was eager to try the Gnocchi.....it didn't disappoint!  The sweet flavor of the Sweet Potato went perfectly with the Gorgonzola Cream Sauce....I was in Heaven!  Wifey enjoyed her Escargot.....we couldn't believe it was only $9!\n\nOverall, we had an awesome time.\n\nWill I return?  Hells Ya!",

My friend lives around the corner, so he recommended coming here for lunch.\n\nI didn't know what to expect, but was happy to find a really clean place.  The restaurant was about 1/2 full during lunchtime on a Tuesday.  On the buffet line you will find at least 12 to 15 different pizzas.  Since I love Pizza and can eat it morning, noon, and night I was in heaven.  I was about to screw up all of my efforts from the morning workout.\n\nHere's a list of what I can remember eating...the slices are small, so it's not as much as it appears...although it was a lot!\n\nPepperoni - Regular Crust\nPepperoni - Thick Crust\nPepperoni - Thin Crust\nPepperoni & Jalapenos\nMacaroni & Cheese - Yes, it's a pizza!  It was just ok though.\nHam & Cheese\nVeggie Thin Crust\nMushroom & Pepperoni\nPepperoni & Sausage\n\nThere were many others that I didn't try.....BBQ Chicken, Hawaiian, and several I can't remember.  Overall, it was great value for the money.\n\nThe people who work here are very friendly too.  They greeted everyone who entered the door & everyone who left.....and it sounded sincere not fake.\n\nThere was a small selection of video games & other games in the back room and tv's.\n\nWill I come back?  When I want to gain 500 lbs....yes!",

The Iceberg Lettuce was crisp and juicy....the thick slices of Bacon added a ton of flavor to it....yum!\n\nThe Better Half enjoyed the Shrimp Cocktail.  She almost got full off the Jumbo Shrimp.\n\nI had the Filet, which was heavenly.  Juicy, charred just right, and full of flavor.  It comes with a choice of sauce and I always get the JG Steak Sauce.  The sauce compliments the Steak and doesn't overwhelm the natural flavor of the Beef.\n\nThe Black Truffle Mac n Cheese is spectacular as well.  Very rich and creamy.\n\nThe prices at this joint are not for the budget-minded diner.  Don't fool yourself....if you don't want to spend the money, don't dine here...you'll be disappointed.  However, if you want a great meal in a chic restaurant with awesome service, then this place is for you.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

    "text": "Found this joint using the Yelp App.  It was 11 am on a Thu and was getting hungry.  I lucked out and found a parking spot right in front of the joint.  The place has the vibe and is decorated in a 50's Diner motif.  Music played from the time period and there's a soda like bar in the center of the restaurant.  The server gave me the menu and after a few minutes I decided to get:\n\nTexas BBQ Burger (Cheddar Cheese, BBQ Ranch Sauce, Onion Rings, Bacon) - $6.15\n http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=8vow_cM6bCgIO0HWGbCizw\nHot Dog (Nathan's Hot Dog, Onions, Relish, Mustard) - $4.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=aJkenAKKYIXTrSK1Of9b0Q\n\nThe food came out pretty fast.  I was pleased to see 2 large pieces of real Bacon sticking out the side of the Burger....yum!  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=82Ua27nge5lTTx9N7g2rAg\nI went for that first.  The Onion Rings in the Burger were nice and crispy and had good flavor.  The BBQ Sauce was slightly tangy and went well with the other ingredients....and of course there's the Bacon.....perfectly cooked, not too burnt not too undercooked, just right!  All together it was an awesome Burger.\n\nNext up was the Hot Dog.  The Dog comes split in half (I like it that way).\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=uPb_Py9o7hP_7UCBsIqc-Q\nCooked just right, the Hot Dog had a nice slight 'snap' to it.  The Onions and Relish were fresh and went together well with all the fixins.\n\nFries came with both orders.....there was too much, so I didn't finish them....but they were very good.  The server was very friendly and was always checking on me.  It was a great dining experience.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

So, while she shopped, I popped in here for a Beer & some food.\n\nI tried the Abondigas Soup and Chips & Salsa.  Both were ok.\n\nThere aren't too many TV's in the restaurant, so I got luck that there were only  few tables and I was able to find one with a good view of one of the TV's.\n\nThe staff was super friendly and attentive.  They were probably wondering what I was doing since I spent 4+ hrs in there watching football while Wifey was shopping.  LOL\n\nWould like to come back for dinner sometime.  The rest of the menu looked pretty tempting.\n\nReturn Factor - 70%",

    "text": "Was looking around Yelp for lunch today and saw @Jennifer R's review.....after reading it and the other review of this place, I had to try it out.  I wanted to beat the lunch rush so I could get a table, so I got there around 11:30.....perfect timing.  I was the only non-Mexican patron in the restaurant (out of 12 people).\n\nThere are four 4 Top tables and one 2 Top table in the restaurant.  I snagged a 4 Top right in front of the counter and ordered a Carne Asada Burrito & a Carne Asada Taco.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a Jarritos Orange Soda in the cooler....of course I had to get one......sweetened with natural sugar & not HFCS, it's one of my fav's.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my food, I went to the Salsa bar and prepared some Red (Hot), Green (Mild), and Pico de Gallo Salsa.  It's a small Salsa bar, but what it lacks in quantity it makes up in quality.  Then I no\nticed in the cooler an odd bottle that said \"Sangria\" on it.....What the Frijoles? (see pics)  So, I went to investigate.....turns out it's \"non-alcoholic\".....dammit, fools gold!  Who would drink that???  blech!\n\nWithin a few minutes my food was ready.  I went for the Taco first.....devoured it in 3 bites.....it was amazing!  The Carne Asada is marinaded with the same flavor I remember back in So Cal.....I think I found Taco Nirvana!  Then I went for the Burrito.....it's a nice size for $3.99, great value.  The Burrito didn't disappoint either!  It was amazing!  A quick note for the Gringos....if you order the Burrito with \"Everything\", it will already have Hot (Red) Salsa inside the Burrito....and it's pretty spicy, so if you're sensitive to that, tell them without salsa.  The Burrito had Carne Asada, Beans, Rice, Salsa, and Onions in it.....good proportions of all ingredients too.  Just like the Taco, the Asada's flavor was just right.\n\nOverall, this place has just launched itself to the top of my Taco Shop list.  Thanks @Jennifer R for that review!\n\nWill I return?  Orale, of course!",

    "text": "Attended the Coffee Crisp UYE here hosted by Jennifer C & Elle C.  I brought my Son along to enjoy the grub and Yelp fun.\n\nWe were first to arrive and since it was packed, we ordered before everyone.  We ordered:\n\n2 Double Doubles Animal Style ($3.05)\n1 Cheeseburger Animal Style ($2.05)\n2 French Fries Animal Style ($3.25)\n\nWe brought our own bottled Water.\n\nAfter a 15 minute wait, our food was ready.....it was already 1 pm and we didn't see any other Yelpers, so we started to eat our food.  The Double Double Animal Style was juicy & sloppy....just how I like it!  (see pics)  There's something about the spongy, toasted Bread, gooey Cheese, fresh Tomato & Lettuce, Special Sauce, and Grilled Onions that makes me want to never stop eating this stuff.  The Animal Style Fries were fantastic as well.\n\nAbout 1/2 way through our meal, I spotted Paolo D & Jennifer C at the door waiting for everyone.  I went over to introduce myself and let them know that we had room at our table and that we'd also keep an eye out for nearby tables to open up so we could all sit together.  We were eventually able to get everyone together.  We all enjoyed a nice meal plus we shared in some Coffee Crisps & Caramilk Bars for dessert courtesy of Elle C from Calgary! (see pics)\n\nWhat a great day & meal.  Great Food & Great People = Good Times\n\nWill I return?  This location is very far away from where I live, but if there's another UYE here, I will try my best to make it.",

After browsing the menu, I asked the server for her recommendations.  She mentioned the Tortilla Soup and the Chicken Sandwich...I decided to order both!\n\nChicken Tortilla Soup, $7\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/swb-southwest-bistro-scottsdale?select=ierF1dcLqbHnkuSYQVBfEQ#ierF1dcLqbHnkuSYQVBfEQ\n\nChicken Sandwich, $13.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/swb-southwest-bistro-scottsdale?select=jP3kNNLapF2saR16v6cu4g#jP3kNNLapF2saR16v6cu4g\n\nThe Tortilla Soup came out first.  I ordered a small size since they didn't have cups and it was a nice sized portion.  It's not as thick as I normally like my Tortilla Soup, but what it lacked in texture, it made up in flavor...this is a good soup!\n\nA short time later, the Chicken Sandwich came out.  This portion size is not too large, it's actually perfect for lunch.  I took one bite out of it and instantly became a fan.  The Bread is a sourdough sandwich roll and went perfectly with the grilled flavor of the Chicken.  The Fries were seasoned with Sea Salt...that makes a huge difference.  I prefer Sea Salt seasoned Fries over regular salted Fries.\n\nOur server and the rest of the staff was very friendly.  The resort atmosphere was very relaxing.  It's a great spot for lunch if you're in the area.\n\nReturn Factor - 95%",

It takes a few minutes for your Burger to be prepared, but it's worth the wait and not nearly as long as Fatburger.  The Burger was made to my specifications (medium).  I loaded it with Jalapenos, Onions, and melted Jalapeno Cheese....yum!\n\nThe employees are always friendly and greet everyone as they walk up to place an order.

I also wanted to try the $1 Spicy McChicken Sandwich.\n\nThe verdict......I didn't like the McRib at all...blech!  The Sauce was the best part about it. Other than that, it was pretty bland.  The Fries were good of course....and the Spicy McChicken Sandwich was decent, not bad for $1.\n\nOverall, it was a complete waste of calories.  I'm not dinging McDonald's for my stupid curiosity, so they get 3 Stars.  The McDonald's experience was A-OK. \n\nDid I find value in my meal?  Not today....my fault though.\nWill I return?

    "text": "I knew better than to stop by here, but I was hungry and I no longer resist the temptation to try some of those \"fresh made\" Breaded Chicken Tenders.  I ordered a 3 Piece Chicken Tender, Bean Burrito, and Western Bacon Cheeseburger.  \n\nIt took a while for the food to come out....I guess they really do make them by hand.  The first item I had was the Western Bacon Cheeseburger.....once upon a time, this was my favorite Burger.  Now, it's just awful.  The Bacon doesn't even taste like Bacon.....it's that paper-thin, pre-cooked, microwave Bacon, blech!  And the Onion Rings inside the Burger were very poor quality....I took one bite and the entire Onion came out of the Ring because it was so tough.\n\nNext up was the Bean Burrito....it was just ok.  I'd rather have a Bean Burrito from Taco Bell or Del Taco.  Don't know why I ordered it.\n\nLast up was the Hand Breaded Chicken Tenders.....I saved them for last because if they were fresh, they'd be piping hot and I don't want to burn my mouth.  I bit into the first piece and yuck!!!  It was rubbery.....just awful.  I didn't finish the rest of them.....what a waste of time, money, and calories. Damn.\n\nThey get 2 Stars instead of 1 Star because the employees were very nice and friendly and the place was clean.  You can have your Happy Star!\n\nReturn Factor - 0.001%",

    "text": "Stopped by on the way to the airport with Mom to have lunch.  I've had this place on my \"To Do\" list for a while.....it was time to give it a try.  The decor is very nice and modern and I like how they are connected to a full service bar and separated by glass.....so the smokers in the bar won't bother the diners.  We were given menus and seated.  We were told that the menu doubles as an order sheet.....in other words, it's a custom Burger joint where you select each item for your Burger.....cool.\n\nAfter browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to go with:\n\nJuicy Lucy Burger w/Regular Bun, BBQ Sauce, Jalapenos, Marinated Onions, American Cheese, Cheddar Cheese $9.50\n+Bacon $1.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag?select=r_g9twzpNXEvAjfXwIG20Q\n\nTall and Thin Fries - $4\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag?select=8hrzsZ1yfIxHC-3pxww4bA\n\nMom went with a Turkey Burger w/Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, and Jalapenos, $8.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag?select=OvID1zfcEgO1ZvMXtMhygg\n\nThe Juicy Lucy is two Burger patties cooked together with the Cheese in the middle between the patties.  I've seen Burgers like this on the Food Network and was anxious to give this a try.\n\nAfter a few minutes our food was ready and I bit into the Juicy Lucy.....the Cheese oozed out of the center of the Burger.....you have to be really careful because it's HOT!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag?select=-IseHtIgiZZxOT1A8n4KpA\nThe Burger was good, but not great....I thought the toppings and Bun were the highlight of the Burger....the Meat was OK, but wasn't great.....I don't know, it was missing \"something\".  The BBQ Sauce was excellent and added some much needed flavor to the Burger.  I liked the Marinated Onions....would like to know how they are prepared.\n\nThe Fries were very good and it's enough to serve 2 people.\n\nMom enjoyed her Turkey Burger, but said she's not sure it was worth $8.  I would agree with her....for the price of our Burgers, I was hoping they would be mind-blowing.....they were good, but not great.  I will probably come back and give it another shot.....maybe I picked the wrong combo of toppings.\n\nReturn Factor - 75%",

There's plenty of TV's and the booths have small, private TV's that you can control the channel selection....perfect for watching a game!\n\nEvery time we come here, I get the Appetizer Platter (Onion Rings, Chicken Fingers, Potato Skins, Quesadillas), $12.50.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=vrTkMnVL__fBIoCQuV537g#vrTkMnVL__fBIoCQuV537g\n\nIt's a large portion of food, so plan on sharing if you order it.

    "text": "After reading many reviews of this place, I decided to stop by here for lunch and try it for myself.  I was please to see how nice the decor of the restaurant was.  There are two dining room areas and bar seating.  The owner, Leticia, greeted me and asked me if I wanted a table or sit at the bar.  Since i was eating alone, I saddled up to the bar and ordered from the Bartender.  \n\nI decided on the Nachos and a Raspberry Iced Tea to wash it down.  While I was waiting for my order a server brought out complimentary Chips, Beans, and Salsa.  In Vegas, it's rare to get Beans with the comp Chips/Salsa....also, there were two Salsas.....a Chipotle based Salsa and an Avocado/Cilantro based Salsa.....it was excellent!\n\nA few minutes later my Nachos came out.  They were covered in Cheese and had two small portions of Sour Cream & Guacamole on top...certainly not enough for the entire dish.  The Nachos has a lot of potential....the Chips were fresh, all of the ingredients tasted very good....but the proportions were all messed up.  Too much Cheese, not enough Sour Cream/Guacamole/Pico de Gallo.....just the right amount of Beans & Jalapenos.  The Cheese was melted just right, but with some bites it overwhelmed the dish.  A lot of potential here...\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the meal and loved the friendly service and active owner who cares about her restaurant.\n\nWill I return?  I want to come back with my family and try a few more dishes.",

    "text": "I love Sandwiches.....so I decided to stop by this joint for lunch recently.  After browsing the menu for a minute, I decided I was going to order the New Yorker (Pastrami, Cole Slaw, Thousand Island Dressing, on Marbled Rye) w/Fries & Pickle for $8.99.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=wYhry_TSaeyE3jlM3kqRTg\nTo wash it down, I ordered a large drink for $2.29.\n\nWhen you walk in, you get into a line like a cafeteria.  Then you place your order with someone who prepares you meal for you and then pay the cashier.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=5tUWH1ZbuhFAMnR5sYaztA\nIt's an efficient process and it allows you to see other people's orders just in case you want to change your mind.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=XQa5ffhPOJPUWHb_ULqogQ\n\nI couldn't wait to take a bite out of my Sandwich.  The Cole Slaw comes inside the Sandwich, which I love.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=Son0jYmuPk8BM11ZBga8dA\nThe only downside to this is that it makes the Sandwich very soggy fast as the Slaw will soak the Bread.  But that's OK with me.  I took one bite and thought the Sandwich was OK.  The flavor was pretty good, but I don't know, it wasn't great......didn't leave me wanting more.  The Fries were pretty good, but again just OK.  The Pickle was very good and was complimentary....very cool.\n\nOverall, it was a good meal.  There are other Sandwiches on the menu that I want to try.\n\nReturn Factor - 65%",

The Edamame was very good, The Potstickers were delish.  The Meatloaf Sliders was the one that I was most interested in, but it came up short.  The Meatloaf was a little bland, lacked a full flavor that I was expecting.  The Garlic Parmesan Fries were very good and full of flavor.  The best item though was the Firecracker Chicken w/Broccoli....nice Spicy flavor and the Sauce that the Chicken was cooked in complimented the dish well.\n\nOverall, it was a decent experience.

    "text": "After browsing the selection of draft Beer, I was pleasantly surprised to see some quality....I started out with a Dogfish Head IPA ($7) and ordered a 10\" Pepperoni Sausage & Jalapeno Pizza ($11.95).  The Pizza came out and to my surprise was very good!  The crust was soft and doughy and tasted great....the Pepperoni and Sausage were good quality.  I normally like Jalapeno on my Pizza, but for some reason I didn't like it this evening and regretted ordering it as it took away from all of the goodness of the rest of the Pizza.  I ended up picking them off the slices.\n\nI watched the Lakers lose to the Bulls....that called for an Abita Purple Haze ($7), which I couldn't believe they carried!  It's brewed out of Louisiana and is hard to find in bars in Las Vegas....bonus!\n\nLater I tried a Duvel ($7), which is a Belgian Beer....very good too.  I'm amazed at the selection of Beer here.\n\nAfter a few hours of fun and games, we left.  Kiddo had a blast with his buddies and discovered a cool place I enjoy on the Strip!\n\nWill I return?  I'm trying to think of an excuse to go back....ha!",

I love Fry Bread and someone recommended this place, but because it's all the way in Mesa, it's taken me a while to finally try it out.  A few colleagues and I came here for lunch and ordered a Cheese Crisp and an Ultimate (Red Sauce, Beans, Cheese, Lettuce, Tomatoes).\n\nThe Cheese Crisp was huge!  It was about 30% larger than a normal Cheese Crisp.  We almost got full on that alone.  \n\nThey make the Fry Bread fresh to order here, so it took a while to get ours.  I couldn't wait to bit into it....when I did, it didn't disappoint.  It was awesome!  So much flavor and very filling.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

When he suggested Tapas for dinner, I was excited to give this joint a try.\n\nThe menu isn't as extensive as other Tapas restaurants, but the quality is exceptional.  We ordered:\n\n- Brava Potatoes (Spicy Tomato, Alioli Sauce, $8)\n- Creamy Risotto (Wild Mushroom, Manchego Cheese, Natural Jus, $10)\n- Pan Tomate (Toasted Bread, Fresh Garlic, Tomato Sauce, $6)\n- Spanish Tortilla (Potatoes, Eggs, Onions, $8)\n- Stuffed Piquillo Peppers (Goat Cheese, Mushrooms, $10)\n- Stuffed Dates (Almond, Applewood Bacon, Spicy Piquillo Pepper Sauce, $8)\n- Bu\u00f1uelos (Spanish Doughnuts, Butterscotch, Caramel, $8)\n\nThe Brava Potatoes were OK.  They had good flavor, but were very filling.  I don't recommend having this if you want to try more than a couple of items....this is a gut-buster.\n\nThe Creamy Risotto was awesome!  I finished it off in no time.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=lMySncNeWzMMnVjutvUdYw\n\nThe Pan Tomate was pretty good....an excellent start for the meal.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=GGXY6sUnEQD0-tlpUFHM_w\n\nThe Stuffed Piquillo Peppers were my favorite...yum!  They cooked just right and the sweet and savory flavor of the Peppers went perfectly with the Goat Cheese and Mushrooms.  I could eat a large plate of those, easily.\n\nMy friend had the Stuffed Dates and the Spanish Tortilla.  He enjoyed both of them.\n\nThe other highlight of my evening was the Bu\u00f1uelos.....damn, these were good!  The Caramel Butterscotch dipping sauce went perfectly with the Spanish Doughnuts.  I love how they have the toothpicks for easy dipping/eating.  They are addicting too because I can't get my mind off of them.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=6365pbJb9_eE-Hj_kxdMtw\n\nOverall, it was a great meal and good times.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

I chose the Burger Bites, Honey-Chipotle Chicken, and the Boneless Wings.  The food was good, not great, but good.  I also had the Blackberry Iced Tea, which was good too....you don't need to sweeten it.\n\nService - The service was very good.

The name is kind of misleading.....I was expecting a sit-down restaurant with table service, what I found was a Coffee Shop (a la Starbucks), except it's locally owned.  I was a little disappointed because I had built up a huge appetite and the menu was very limited.\n\nAfter a few minutes I decided to get their Cheese Pannini.  When I arrived, there was only 1 person in front of me, so I thought the service was going to be fast.....it wasn't.  It took almost 15 minutes to make my Paninni.....which for a sit-down restaurant wouldn't be bad, but for an order at the counter type place, it's kind of a long time.  I arrived just before the lunch rush (11:30 am)....while I was waiting, it got very busy with 10 people in line or so.  They are single threaded here with their food preparation, so I can't imagine how long they will have to wait for their food.\n\nAnyway, when my food came out, it looked great.  I couldn't wait to take a bite of the Paninni.  It was as good as it looked, very good!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA?select=iM-bmUJgFX3I3lpLT57uTQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA?select=E2YbzDiWAomUXZQu3VtjSw\nThe Tomato Sauce in the Paninni was great and full of flavor.  The Bread was very tasty too.  The Paninni came with a very small side of greens which also went well with the dish.  I wish there were more greens.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience.  However, for those with large appetites, I wouldn't suggest it....the portions are too small and ordering two Paninnis wouldn't be cost effective.  The joint is situated between a bunch of office buildings and is suited more for that crowd than a casual diner.  The staff is very nice here and makes a sincere attempt and getting to know their guests.  They asked me what my name was and where I was from, where I heard about the place, etc.....and they knew several of the people who stopped by for lunch by their 1st name....I'm guessing by the way they were dressed that they worked in one of the buildings nearby.\n\nReturn Factor - 30%",

They don't add too many Onions & Tomatoes, which is a mortal sin for Guac and most restaurants do that.  The Queso Fundido is excellent and comes with fresh, homemade Tortillas....definitely not store bought.\n\nFor the entree, I had the Tampiquena, which is a Steak cut thin and served with an Enchilada, Corn Mash, and Guacamole.....another excellent dish!  The Enchilada is covered in Mole Sauce, which offers a smooth, chocolatey taste to compliment the Steak.  Amazing.\n\nKiddo and The Wife had the Chicken Mole Poblano and the Barbacoa Taquitos.  They loved their dishes and finished their plate.\n\nDessert was the Capirotada and the Trio de Helados Fritos.  All I can say is yum!  I could only muster a bite of each because I was stuffed.  The family finished the rest.\n\nService was spectacular throughout dinner.  I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Scottsdale.\n\nReturn Factor - 95%",

    "text": "Part of the Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition, this place came recommended by Yelper Jessie B.  I had this place bookmarked, but forgot about it until she mentioned that I might enjoy the Laduca Hero.  So, I made the drive out to this joint as soon as I could fit it in my schedule.  The place serves fresh food and also deli items to take home....and it's decked out in New York Giants stuff....pennants, posters, pictures, etc.  I came here for the food, not to watch sports, so what do I care?!\n\nHere's the breakdown of what I ordered:\n\nLaduca's Hero $7.49 (Proscuitto, Cappocolla, Mortadella, Salami, Provolone, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Dressing)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_HrCJz_uXDumBhdxCrug7Q?select=ZBp23lke_JRM706KDByCiQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_HrCJz_uXDumBhdxCrug7Q?select=SH4XFtBdqM5bAyXhJ6x23A\n\nSlice of Sausage Pizza $2\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_HrCJz_uXDumBhdxCrug7Q?select=gnXfZREjW-ZttJn2bqoqmw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_HrCJz_uXDumBhdxCrug7Q?select=JLS_UPj416kvrld6hcdHFQ\n\nI started with the Laduca's Hero Sandwich, which was pretty big.  The Bread is a Hard Roll Italian Bread.....so if you're not into Hard Rolls, this may not be for you.  The combination of Meats and ingredients was very good and tasty.  I could have used more Dressing on it though....it was a little dry, but I enjoyed the Sandwich very much.  Fresh ingredients and well made Sammie!\n\nNext up was the Slice of Sausage Pizza.  This year's Bender Tour has been the Year of the Sausage Pizza.....I don't know, but I've been craving it this time around.  The Crust is New York Thin Crust and there is a ton of Cheese on this bad boy!  If you want to eat this with your hands, you have to fold it.....otherwise you have no chance.  The Sauce is minimal....it could have used a little more Sauce in my opinion.  The Sausage was excellent.....freshly made and full of flavor....yum!\n\nOverall, it was a pretty good experience....food solid, service OK.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%.....would be higher if I lived nearby.",

If you close your eyes and walk in the door, you couldn't tell if you're in a Zaba's, Chipotle, or Q'doba.  What the hell are these chains doing?\n\nBack to the experience....I ordered a Steak Burrito w/Pinto Beans, Rice, Cheese, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Salsa, and Hot Sauce on a Whole Wheat Tortilla.  Of course the Guac was extra.  I also ordered a side of Chips & Queso Dip.....yeah, I was hungry.\n\nThey make it in front of you, so there's no wait.  Had a bottle of Water to wash it down.\n\nThe Burrito is so/so.....it ranks a distant 3rd behind Q'doba & Chipotle for me.  The Steak was a little tough and didn't have much flavor.  The Hot Sauce/Beans/Guac had all of the flavor.  The Whole Wheat Tortilla was tasty.....don't know if it was healthy, but I'm going to just tell myself to believe it was OK?\n\nThe Chips & Queso Dip were very good.....but I was gaining poundage with each bite.....started to regret ordering it.....tasted awesome, but felt guilty consuming extra calories.\n\nOverall, it was OK.\n\nWill I return?

The man behind the register asked me if he could help out....I told him my situation and he was very happy to help me decide what to get.  He suggested a Cheese Enchilada ($6.99).\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA?select=diO_EDsbajdUCPr988G3Ng\nI went with his suggestion and also added a Bean & Cheese Burrito ($4.29) for good measure.....ha!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA?select=ufDngqGNAIWOrMqXuAzvng\n\nHe chatted me up while ringing up my order and I discovered he was Phrank, the owner.  He's such a cool guy.  He's from So Cal and we were talking a bit about the State as I'm also a So Cal transplant.....although I left many years before he did.\n\nAfter a few minutes he brought out my order.  I was pleased to see that the Cheese Enchilada also came with a side of Rice & Beans....although it meant that I ordered too much food.  Sometimes my stomach tricks me into these situations.  Oh well.\n\nI went for the Cheese Enchilada first....and yum!  It was very, very good.  I'm glad Phrank suggested it to me.  Next up was the Burrito.....unfortunately, after all of the flavor from the Enchilada, the Burrito tasted just OK.  For a Bean Burrito though, it was solid.  Next time I'm going to order just one or the other.\n\nI'll have to come back after Lent so I can try out some of the other signature dishes.  If they're as good as the Cheese Enchilada, I'll be back a lot.\n\nReturn Factor - 97%",

    "text": "Ok, I was heading home after checking out another Pizzeria and decided today was Pizza day and stopped by here to give it a try.\n\nI didn't expect to find a nice restaurant, but that's exactly what the place is like.  It's tucked between the Summerlin renowned Kona Grill & Gordon Biersch in the Boca Park Shopping Center.  This spot has failed numerous times over the past 5 years.....I hope these people make it.\n\nAnyway, I sat at the bar and ordered a Blue Moon.  They don't serve Pizza by the slice here....so I had to go for a 12\" Personal Pizza.  Since I already had 3 slices from the other joint, I knew I had my work cut out for me despite the small size.  I decided on a Pepperoni & Jalapeno Pizza.....the bartender Aubrey or was it Audrie?....anyway, she said the Jalapenos kick your ass, so was I sure I wanted it......of course I do!\n\nThe restaurant has a cool & comfortable feel to it.  I'll have to bring the family back sometime soon.\n\nAfter a few minutes my Pizza came out.  It was much larger than I expected.  The thin crust was cooked nice and cripsy....well done, just how I like it.  However, there is a lot of sauce on this Pizza.....more than I normally like, -2 in my book.  \n\nThe flavor of the sauce overwhelms the Pizza, so it's hard to taste the other ingredients.  The Pepperoni is the tiny almost Slim Jim type and had good flavor to it....too bad it was drowned in sauce.  Aubrey/Audrie was right, the Jalapenos do pack a serious Punch.....I was sweating pretty good after a couple of slices, and no it wasn't from the 100 degree DRY Vegas heat....it was from the Jalapenos.....good thing Aubrey/Audrie kept my Blue Moon full.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the atmosphere, service, and the Pizza.\n\nWill I return?  Yes, I will bring the family with me next time and try a different pie.",

The menu was pretty extensive, so I went for an old standard....the Carne Asada Burrito, which I thought was a bit pricey for $4.99 as I've found some really good places lately much cheaper than that.  \n\nWhile I was waiting for my food, I noticed a small Salsa Bar in the corner.  It was your typical bar with Green & Red Chile Salsa and the pickled vegetables.\n\nI didn't have to wait long for my Burrito.  The size of the Burrito was large...they definitely didn't hold back.  After the first bite, the flavor tasted familiar.....it took me a few more bites before I placed it.....it tasted exactly like Roberto's Carne Asada Burrito.  From the the flavor of the meat to the Guacamole Salsa to the Flour Tortilla....it was IDENTICAL!\n\nI'm not a huge fan of Roberto's, so I was underwhelmed.\n\nWill I return?  Eh...if I'm hungry and in a pinch....but it's not my first preference when I'm looking for a Taco Shop.",

Wish I could remember what was in the Sliders, but I can't.....let's just say it was a long night.  I can tell you that out of the 3 Sliders, I really liked one of them and didn't care for the other two.  The Fries were OK, not great.\n\nDespite the large crowd, the bartenders were on top of their game and the service was really good.  The food was hot and fresh and my glass was never empty....for this, they get 4 Stars.  If it was purely on the food, it would get 3 Stars.\n\nWill I return?  Sure.",

The Sandwich Artist did an OK job with the Sammie....she went a little light on the Veggies, so that was the only downside to it.\n\nOverall, an OK experience at Subway.

It took my eyes a few minutes to adjust to the darkness.  After I got my bearings, I saddled up to the bar and asked the bartender what they had on tap.  He said they had no domestics on tap and mumbled off a short list....all I remember hearing was Alaskan Ale, so I said let's go for that.  Wait, isn't that domestic?  Ha, ok....\n\nHe brought me a pint and I sat back and watched Sports Center while a handful of guys played Video Poker at the bar.  They serve food here as I saw a patron get a Burger & Fries.....the weird thing is that they allow smoking at the Bar...hmmm, you're not suppose to be able to eat and smoke in the same place.  They must not care about getting fined.  Whatever....the place smells like a smoker's den, so I guess it attracts smokers.  I don't think the regulars care.\n\nThe bartender was friendly but quiet....not much of a talker.\n\nI had my 2 Beers and left to meet my buddy for lunch @ Geri's.\n\nWill I return?

Because while we were there a soccer team with over 20 kids plus their families and coaches came in to eat.....and the CiCi's staff kept up with the massive demand of Pizza.  They'e really good at their jobs....and the Pizza is decent too.\n\nWill I return?  You can count on it.",

    "text": "I decided to stop there today for lunch.  It is around the corner from my house, so it was very convenient.\n\nFood - There were so many sandwiches that looked good.  I decided to go with the Elliott Ness....which was Hot Pastrami, Cole Slaw, and Fries in a Hard Roll.  The sandwich was very good.  Not the best I've ever had, but good.  The fries were large, steak fries.  I thought there was too many fries and not enough pastrami.  \n\nThe size of the sandwich was perfect.  I don't like sandwiches that are too small or large.  I was concerned that the Hard Roll might be too hard, but it was just right.\n\nFor side orders, I got chips and a soda.  This place is rated as a single $ for price...which is suppose to be $10 or less....but I rated it $$.....1 sandwich, chips, and a soda was $12.21.\n\nThere were only 2 types of chips to choose from....regular and cheetos.....I wish they had more to choose from.  There were a lot of fresh made dessert items to choose from and Tastykakes for those of you from back East....I know my East Coast friends go bananas over them.\n\nService - everyone there was very nice and the food came out fast and fresh.  There was a guy who delivered your sandwich to your table and cleaned up after you.  That surprised me...nice touch.  You can tell it's a family run business....I hope they never lose that connection.\n\nI rated it 4 Stars.  There are so many other items I want to try here....it could move up to 5 stars if I get blown away by one of the other sandwiches and if they get a more diverse chip selection.\n\nWill I come back?  You can bet on it.....",

If you don't like Hard Bread, you may not enjoy this place.  I think they offer other Bread, but I'd call before you come down here.\n\nThis was my 2nd time trying the Johnny Sack.....damn, it was good!  So good, I'm upping my rating for this joint to 5 Stars.  The kicker for me was the Tomatoes soaked in Balsamic Vinegar & Olive Oil....wow, that Sweet/Sour flavor brought out the flavors of the Meat & Sharp Provolone....what a great combination of ingredients!  The Johnny Sack didn't have that the last time I was here.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.\n\nWill I return?  Don't be silly....of course!",

Well, it happened last weekend while I was at the Galleria Mall to watch the B-Boy Battle Swagger competition.\n\nI ordered a Big Mac and one of the new Angus Beef Bacon Cheeseburgers.  To wash it down, I ordered a bottle of Water.....hey, I had to do something healthy to not feel so bad, right?\n\nThe food came out on time, but they were out of bottled Water....so they gave me the one on display.....huh?! I thought it was hilarious.\n\nAnyway, I got my Big Mac fix and thought the Angus Bacon Cheeseburger was alright.\n\nWill I return?  Only during the next Big Mac Attack.",

While I don't eat at McDonald's too often, this one in particular was impressive....why?  Well, for starters they open both drive thru windows, which makes it go 2x faster.....many fast food places no longer open the second window and it takes forever to get through.\n\nI ordered 2 Sausage McMuffin Sandwiches and a Bottle of Water.  The service was quick, the food was hot and fresh.  What more could I ask for?\n\nWill I return?  Next time I'm in a pinch for breakfast, you bet!",

    "text": "Tucked away in the town of Paradise Valley, this place is a local legend.  It was one of the first places I visited when I moved here a couple of years ago.  Since then, we come here every once in a while to meet friends for drinks or to entertain people from out of town.  The Better Half and I enjoy the \"Southwestern\" decor and atmosphere here, but it's done in an upscale & classy way.\n\nWhen we dine here, my fav menu items are:\n\n9 oz Filet, $41\nTruffle Fries, $7\nScalloped Potatoes, $7\n\nI try not to come here when I'm super hungry because the Filet is only 9 oz.  It's very good and the portion is just right for a normal hunger level, but it's kind of small for a big appetite night.  The Truffle Fries are amazing and the Scalloped Potatoes are delish....but filling.\n\nWe enjoy sitting outside here.  They keep their exterior furniture very clean and it's comfortable, especially during the Fall & Spring.  The building & complex is huge....I guess they can do fairly large special events here.  The only special events I've attended here are business mixers or industry cocktail events....but I've heard it's fantastic for weddings, anniversaries, and reunions as well.\n\nThe service here is great.  Nice employees who are friendly and accommodating work here.  There's plenty of parking in the back or a valet service if you choose to use it up front.\n\nReturn Factor - 91%",

As a matter of fact, they know that we'll start with a Cheese Crisp and Spicy Salsa so before we sit down they're already working on the order.  I like great service like this.\n\nThere's also a lot of TV's in the restaurant, so we come here for lunch on Saturday or Sunday and watch football while we eat.\n\nOverall, it is definitely a 4 Star experience in my book.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

    "text": "Garden of the Dragon recently opened for lunch hour.  I've eaten here three times in the past month.\n\nAppetizer - I always get the sweet & sour cucumbers.  There's just enough chili pepper in them to give it a nice kick.  The pork potstickers are excellent as well.  Kimchee is offered on the menu, but I'm not a fan....so I have no opinion of that dish.\n\nEntree - I usually get the vegetable fried rice.  It's not the best I've ever eaten, but it's good.\n\nDessert - I rarely get dessert here, but on my last visit I got a Mango Sorbet.  It was served on a dish and the server brought me a spoon to eat it with....which was very difficult because the hard texture made digging into it with a spoon challenging.  In the end, I used a fork to eat it.",

    "text": "Thanks to Living Social, we found the place.  With all of the options for dining in Old Town, we wouldn't have found this place without the deal.  It's a nice bar/sports bar type feel with well appointed patio seating.  We sat outside all 4 times we came here because the weather was perfect.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nBottle of Santa Martina Red Blend, $26\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=nsNAAMUY7sNq9bOgScB93A#nsNAAMUY7sNq9bOgScB93A\n\nRnR Sliders, $9\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=hXj4aoapioaosLF-qZXPkg#hXj4aoapioaosLF-qZXPkg\n\nBacon Brussels Burger, $15\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=c_cVWHczMxL8ESy1gLCkkw#c_cVWHczMxL8ESy1gLCkkw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=KowEFn_SZfJzcZK6Za1QWQ#KowEFn_SZfJzcZK6Za1QWQ\n\nSouthwest Burger, $13\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=5G_nZ1dHbeWQzBRE0CBclg#5G_nZ1dHbeWQzBRE0CBclg\n\nBleu Cheese Burger, $13\n\nAnimal Fries\n\nHangover Fries\n\nNachos, $10\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=hQTl2WZOQXTKtP_KjXoW2A#hQTl2WZOQXTKtP_KjXoW2A\n\nThe Burgers here are really good.  Out of all of them, my favorite was the Southwest Burger...very good and juicy.\n\nThe Nachos were above average.  They use a healthy dose of Queso Cheese and it's pretty good.\n\nThe Animal Fries is nothing like the In-n-Out version....it's a huge pile of BBQ Pork on top of the Fries....very good and can easily feed 3 people.\n\nThe Hangover Fries was very unique....a little Egg on top of Cheesy Fries...yum!\n\nThe food here was the highlight because the service here is not that good.  During all 4 visits we had issues with slow service.  During one visit, we were seated at our table and it took 15 minutes before anyone came over to get our drink order....we were very close to leaving.  Because it's not easy to park and get here, it would've been a hassle to leave and go somewhere else, so we stuck around.  If they can improve their service, they'll have a good chance to make this a special spot in my mind.\n\nSome other random notes/tips:\n\n- There's an ATM in the back near the Men's restroom if you need cash.  It's kind of an odd spot for it.\n\n- Parking sucks, especially when there's a farmers market down there....they close off the parking structure in the back for the market so you're left to find street parking or park around the corner in one of the healthcare lots, which you're not supposed to do.\n\n- There's plenty of TV's and this place is an awesome spot to watch sports.\n\n- I really like the music they play here.  The nights we were there, they played upbeat house music....love it.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this place 3.5 Stars but rounding up to 4 because I think it has so much potential.  If the service continues to suck, I'll have to drop it.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",

    "text": "I was in Scottsdale for 1 night and the local Yelpers on Talk suggested I check out Pomo, so I dropped by for dinner and to add a Scottsdale Pizza joint to my Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition.  I was solo and there was a 15-25 minute wait for a table.  I didn't mind and waited until my name was called.\n\nAfter a 20 min wait, I was seated.  My server's name was Michelle and she was very enthusiastic and helpful.  After browsing the menu, I decided to get the Don Alfonso (Tomatoes San Marzano DOP, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Italian Salame Piccante, Italian Sausage, Roasted Bell Pepper, $14.95) and a glass of house Cabernet ($6).  The Pizza is Napoletana Style....Google it if you don't know what it is.\nhttp://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=napoletana+pizza\n\nAfter a short wait my Pizza was brought out.  I took a bite out of the first slice and instantly became a fan!  The Crust was soft and chewy and the ingredients were fresh....it reminded me of the Pizza I had in Napoli, Italy.  I finished the entire Pizza and still wanted more when I was finished.  The middle of the Pizza is soft and wet, so if you don't prefer your Pizza this way, don't come here.  You'll be missing out on some great Pizza though!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A?select=Me5jFmm9lrWCfKaRI4OtFQ\n\nAfter dinner Michelle suggested a dessert.  I went for the Bigne Al Cioccolato (Cream Puffs Filled With Light Pastry Cream and Drizzled With  Chocolate, $7.95).  I'm glad Michelle suggested it, because it was fantastic!  The Cream Puffs were excellent and the Chocolate wasn't too heavy....just the way I like it!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A?select=LEZcnTOv7H9irlpSm7dMhA\n\nOverall, it was an awesome dinner.  I'm glad I listened to the local AZ Yelpers.  Can't wait to come back.\n\nReturn Factor - 99%\n\nThis is for Lydia & MacRae - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOG3rD5CrQ",

Today was the day.  I ordered the Classic Smash Burger 1/3 lb and a Chicago Dog.\n\nThe woman working at the counter was very friendly.  I ordered it to eat in because I wanted to make sure I tasted it fresh out of the kitchen.  Within 5-6 minutes my order was ready.\n\nI decided to attack the Smash Burger first....I should have chosen the Dog...why?  Because the Beef was piping hot and it burned the hell out of my mouth!  Delicious though, but not awesome.  I could barely taste the special Smash Sauce, so the burger tasted kind of bland.....it was fresh though and the Egg Bun was awesome.\n\nNext I attacked the Chicago Dog.....the toppings and bun were excellent, but the Hot Dog itself wasn't great....just good.  This is where that 1/2 Star comes in again.\n\nAgain, overall I'd rate this place 3.5 Stars.\n\nWill I return?  Yes, but it didn't surpass my beloved In-N-Out as so many reviews have said.",

    "text": "Ok, I finally tried out the Slider Truck today.  They were on my side of town, so everything fell into place.\n\nI was surprised when I went to the window to order...Rick recognized me.  It kind of shocked me when he called me by name...he must have been monitoring the Twitter account, because that was the only way he could have known I was coming because we've never met.  Anyway, that was impressive.\n\nI ordered the Barbie & the Pep Pep.  While I was waiting for my food, I noticed that most of the people who were there were repeat customers.  They have done a great job of promoting their business via social networking.\n\nAfter a short wait my food was ready.  I couldn't wait to try it out.  I first attacked the Barbie....it was very tasty and fresh.  It didn't take me long to devour it.  The BBQ sauce and jalapeno peppers went well together.  The Pep Pep was next....and it was even better.  I especially like the sauce.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give them 5 Stars is because of the eating experience itself.  It was pretty windy and I was planning to eat in my car....but because of how messy the sliders are, I didn't want to get it all over my car or clothes, so I ate outside.  It wasn't very pleasant or ideal.  I understand that's how it works with food trucks, but I guess that's why I'm not a fan of most.  At least they give you wet wipes to clean up.\n\nWill I return?  If they're located nearby or relatively close, I will.  i won't drive to the other side of town for it.",

    "text": "I've heard a lot about Raising Cane's, so I decided to try it out for myself today for lunch.  I ordered the Chicken Sandwich Combo w/Fries & a Bottle of Water and I ordered two Chicken Strips on the side.\n\nSince I ordered it to dine in, they gave me a receipt and said they would bring it out to my table.  While I was waiting for my meal, I looked around and saw many customers enjoying their food.  I must be getting old because I felt like the music was way too loud in the restaurant.\n\nAfter a short wait the girl who took my order brought my food out.  I tried a few of the Fries first....they are the crinkled variety.....they were good, but not great.  Next I bit into the Chicken Sandwich.....***Caution, the Chicken is extremely hot***  I burned the hell out of my mouth with that first bite.....the Chicken must have come right out of the fryer.  Wow!  I couldn't taste anything because my taste buds were wiped off the face of the Earth!\n\nI munched on a few more Fries while I waited for the Chicken to cool down a bit.  After a few minutes I finished the rest of the Sandwich and thought it was good....but again, not great.  The Sauce in the Sandwich was the highlight.  The Chicken was just OK.....was kind of bland to me.  I then tried the 2 Chicken Strips I ordered on the side.....again, I thought they were kind of bland.  The quality of the Chicken was very good though.....nice, tender White Meat Chicken....just not enough flavor for my tastes.\n\nWill I return?  Probably not....it just didn't \"Wow\" me.",

This is an authentic Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich!  The Beef is moist, full of flavor, and the Bread holds it all together perfectly.  The Giardiniera is hot and spicy and makes the Sandwich even better.  I like to get the Gravy on the side so I can add more flavor as needed while I'm devouring the Sandwich.\n\nThe French Fries here are awesome too.  They remind me of the Fries at 5 Guys except they don't have the spice options that they offer there.  Doesn't matter, the Fries here are excellent....and addicting.  \n\nThe rest of the family loves this place too.  We're very happy to have it so close to our neighborhood.\n\nReturn Factor - 97%",

    "text": "My friends....I think I've died and gone to Tapas Heaven....seriously.  The Better Half and I were at the Hard Rock and decided to check out Johnny Smalls.  You can imagine the look on our face when we saw the sign that said $19.99 AYCE....seriously, check out the pics.  We thought there was a catch and asked the hostess.  She said, no joke it's $19.99 per person.  You didn't have to ask us twice.....they were packed, so we were forced to saddle up to the bar and eat there instead of a table.  No big deal, we enjoy doing that from time to time.\n\nWe were looking over the menu, which has a ton of items to choose from, and the bartender gave us the ground rules.....it's simple.  Each person gets to order 2 Tapas, if you finish both plates you can order 2 more, it stops when you stop finishing your plate.  If you decide you want to order more food and you didn't finish your last order, you have to pay full price for the Tapas plate.....seems fair to me.\n\nSince the average price per Tapas is around $7, each person needs to order at least 3 Tapas to be \"in the money\".....aka \"get your money's worth\".\n\nI was starving, so I knew I was going to eat my money's worth.  Here's a breakdown of each round of Tapas (see pics):\n\nRound 1\nCrab & Artichoke Dip (Creamy Cheese, Lump Crab, 'Junk Basket' Chips)\nTempura Green Beans (Tempura Battered, Thai Chili Sauce)\nPhilly-ish (Warm Flat Iron Steak, Chipotle Mayo, Roasted Peppers, Farmstead White Cheddar)\nChili Dogs (Mini Pinks, Kobe Chili)\n\nRound 2\nSmall Balls (Creamy Risotto, Shortribs, Parmesan Fondue)\nJack & Coke (Kobe Beef, Sweet Whiskey Cola, Pancetta)\nNuttin' Honey (Battered Rock Shrimp, Honey-Walnut Glaze, Candied Walnuts)\nOctapussy (Tapioca Battered Calamari, Basil, Candied Orange)\n\nRound 3\nShorty (Braised Short Ribs, Baked Apple Chips, Sage, Savory Virgin Oil)\nTuscan Pizza (esto Base, Fresh Mozzarella, Marinated Tomatoes, Roasted Peppers, Balsamic Vinaigrette)\n\nEverything was excellent except the Chili Dogs (kind of plain & bland).\n\n***TIP*** - The Pizzas are pretty big for Tapas.  Order it last if you want to sample a lot of Tapas so you won't get full early in the meal.\n\nOver the course of the meal, we ordered 3 glasses of Merlot ($9 ea) and we were able to keep the bill to $72.41 plus a $15 tip, $87.41 total damage.

    "text": "So after a disastrous lunch @ Los Antojos, I had to redeem myself.  I read a few reviews about this place and it's near my end of town, so I decided to check it out on the way home from the office.\n\nWhen I arrived there, I was shocked to see that the entire strip mall that this place is in was empty!  It was kind of Twilight Zonish creepy....I took pics, check it out....just weird.\n\nAnyway, I walked in and was pleasantly surprised to see that it was spacious....I was expecting a small joint with a couple of tables.  I think the owners are from Boston....lots of Boston sports memorabilia on the walls.....and since it was dead, 3 of the workers were changing the channel to put on the Dodgers vs Red Sox game.  Cool!\n\nI ordered the 2 Slices of Cheese Pizza special with a Bottle of Water.  Total damage was $5.15....what a deal!\n\nThe guy who took my order brought out the Pizza on paper plates.  The Pizza is thin sliced NY style Pizza.  The Pizza was pretty good.  Of course I folded it per standard MO for thin sliced Pizza.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience.  I'll have to come back to try their pepperoni and veggie pizzas.\n\nWill I return?  Of course!",

    "text": "When Ken M told me about his idea to have a UYE for the Buffet of Buffets ($45.99) and do it in 1 day, I thought it was a great idea.....so I told him if he did it, I would be there.  Well, the day finally came and 7 of us embarked on a journey to accomplish this task on a Saturday in March.  I wrote a review for each buffet we went to (links to each review below).  The schedule is below:\n\nBreakfast\n\n9:00 am - Caesars Palace: Lago Buffet\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/lago-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:ab5b7QIzLhhN_ixM5s1yrQ\n10:30 am - Flamingo: Paradise Garden Buffet\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/paradise-garden-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:gBCZai1zqnPpWw-q0zyt0w\n\nLunch\n\n12:00 pm - Imperial Palace: Emperor's Buffet\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/emperors-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:t-h1fgV4T-Lvin80jWxbPg\n1:30 pm - Harrah's: Flavors Buffet\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/flavors-the-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:5mGaPZ_ukWUoVg2GttnHZA\n3:00 pm - Rio: Carnival World Buffet\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/carnival-world-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:8xW8Mr61rcZ9SsJyG8uK_w\n\nDinner\n\n5:00 pm - Paris: Le Village Buffet\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/le-village-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:m2YKMThWKZYkLXtt_0zNpA\n7:00 pm - Planet Hollywood: Spice Market Buffet\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/the-spice-market-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:T3hJAv1ROUL5uVY92C2o4A\n\nI had a plan to pace myself so I could enjoy the entire day of buffets.....well, of course that plan went out the window with Buffet #1.....and it was downhill from there....I was stuffed by the time we were done with the Flamingo Buffet.  Needless to say, I gained 5.5 lbs after this ordeal.....and I'm still trying to work off the lbs in the gym.\n\nOverall, it was a fun time and I recommend giving it a try at least once.  The schedule we had was perfect and we were on time for every buffet, except the last one.....but that was because there was a concert that night at Planet Hollywood and it made parking a little longer than expected.  If I was to do it again, I'd only go to 3 Buffets.....the Rio, Harrah's, and Planet Hollywood.  I'd have Dinner at the Rio & Planet Hollywood, and Lunch at Harrah's.  Those were the 3 best buffets out of the group and you can easily fit 3 of those in a 24 hour schedule.\n\nThe 7 in one day was very agressive and I won't do it again.....but I don't regret participating in the event.....all of the Yelpers in our group had a blast.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",

    "text": "The latest in the Saga of Eating Challenges.....Stoney's North Forty was selected as the location for the 4 lb Omelet eating challenge.  Scheduled for a 9 AM start, I had to rush to get there in time to witness the action.  Four guys in our group of 12 were going for it.\n\nI didn't participate in the Challenge, but posted some pics of the Giant Omelette & participants.  I brought my Son along to witness the tomfoolery.  We opted to split an order of Potato Skins....yeah, I know B-O-R-I-N-G.....compared to the 4 lb Omelet, but I knew there was no way I could do it and I didn't feel like starting off my Sunday with a major stomachache.  The Skins were topped with Sour Cream, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, and Green Onions....Ranch was provided for dipping.  To wash it down, I had an Iced Tea.\n\nOur food came out pretty fast and the waitress was pretty cool to handle our huge order.  The Omelets came out first.....they are really, really BIG!  Not only is it a giant Omelet....but it's covered in Gravy, and you must eat 2 Biscuits & Hasbrowns in addition to that thing in order to complete the challenge.  Scott T gave it a valiant effort and came up a few ounces short of finishing the Omelet....seriously, check out the pic....he was soooo close, but couldn't do it.  Ken M who organized this thing did ok....respectable.....plus had ate it with a Shiner Bock....+1 for Ken for a Beer at 9 AM!\n\nOur Skins were very tasty.....the combination of toppings went well together.  The Sour Cream was drizzled over the top of the Skins instead of a blob of it that you have to put on yourself.....for some reason I prefer it drizzled over the Skins like they do it.  The Skins are very large too.....and stuffed full of the toppings....I'm glad I split it with my Son.....I was full after eating 1/2 of the order.\n\nLooking around the joint, it's a Country Western Dance Hall at night with plenty of room on the dance floor.  There's also a mechanical Bull in the corner for those who dare.....needless to say, nobody in our group was in the mood for a Bull Ride.....not after trying to house a 4 lb Omelet, ha!\n\nOverall, it was a great time....Will I return?  Yee haw!  that means \"Yes\" in Cowboy....I think.",

The Cajun Fries are outstanding and the Burgers are top notch.\n\nWe also love the Coke machine that has a ton of flavors and you can create your own soft drink creation.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/five-guys-burgers-and-fries-scottsdale?select=3NnaUO95WFTGCgD4q3Ke5w#3NnaUO95WFTGCgD4q3Ke5w\n\nThe kids who work here are pretty cool too.  They get a bump up in Stars.\n\nReturn Factor - 85%",

    "text": "Wanted to search for a new restaurant in the neighborhood that I haven't tried yet and stumbled across this joint on Yelp.  Stopped by at 10:45 am and they were slow, so I could take my time figuring out what i wanted to order.\n\nThis is an unusual Sandwich Shop.  Unusual because you place an order by:\n\n1 - Selecting a Sandwich Bag, which is a brown paper bag that your Sandwich gets placed into.  Each bag corresponds to a specific type of Sandwich, ie Italian, Turkey, Veggie, etc.\n\n2 - On the bag, there are several options for you to check off.....toppings, dressing, sauce, cheese, extras, etc.  You mark off the items you want with a Sharpie Pen.\n\n3 - You had the bag over to the cashier, who charges you for the meal and then hands the bag to a crew of people who make the Sandwich per your specifications.\n\n4 - After a short wait, you get your customized Sandwich.\n\nI decided to order the #7 Italian Grinder (Salami, Pepperoni, Cappicola), on a White Roll topped with Provolone, Mayo, Mustard, Fat Free Italian Dressing, Red Onions, Lettuce, Tomato, Pepperoncini, Oil, Vinegar, Salt, Pepper, Oregano.....(see pics for full options on bag).  I got a combo meal which includes Chips & a Soda for $7.75, not a bad deal!  I grabbed a bag of Jalapeno Chips and for the drink I mixed Mello Yellow with low calorie Lemonade.....that was a mistake.  It was nasty, so I dumped it and just filled it with Mello Yellow.\n\nAfter a few minutes my Sandwich came out.  It was nice and hot....I didn't expect it to be heated, but I guess that's how it comes.  The Sandwich is wrapped in butcher paper and tin foil and cut in half for you.  I took one bite and instantly became a Fan!  It was soo good!  The Bread was awesome and the proportion of ingredients was just right.  The Meat was full of flavor and the combination of Spices, Dressing, and Mayo/Mustard added to the Sandwich.\n\nThis is a 4 Star place for me because the Value you get for the money is ridiculously good....the Sandwich by itself would have only been $5.50!  Plus there are tons of other Sandwich options ie Veggie, Bacon & Ham, Meatloaf, Spam, Caprese, and much more.  The employees were great and very helpful.  I asked them what I had to do because of their unique ordering process and they took the time to explain it to me.\n\nSide Note - While I was there, I noticed that the Duke of the Joint checked-in.....but I didn't see him anywhere.  He's either an employee who was hiding in the back or works nearby and ghost check-ins to maintain his Dukedom.....that's the 1st time I've noticed that.\n\nWill I return?  There's no doubt about it!",

Here's why:\n\nI stopped in for lunch and saw their recommended Sandwich of the Week.....a Nachowich (Black Bean Patty, Cheese Whiz, Salsa, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Jalapenos, Avocado)....total with tax & a bag of Chips, $7.95.  It pique'd my interest and went for it, despite not being a Vegetarian.  Of course I added a few things....Pepper Jack Cheese & Hot Pepper Mix.\n\nAfter a short wait, they called my name and out came my Nachowich.....I took one bite and was in Heaven!  Damn, that's a great Sandwich!  As I said before, I'm not a Vegetarian and unless I'm fasting, I rarely order a Veggie dish.....but took a chance on this recommendation and loved it!  It left me wanting more....I should have went for a 14\" bad boy in this 'Wich!\n\nThey deserve the 1 Star bump.\n\nWill I return?  Now I know where to go when I do my annual fast....you can bet on it!",

    "text": "Went to Gary Canter's Deli for lunch with my wife and friends from California.  The deli is located between the Race & Sports Book  and the Poker Room.  It's kind of hard to find if you don't know where you're going.\n\nI had the Gary Canter Special, which was a huge sandwich with Pastrami, Corned Beef, Turkey, Honey Ham, Muenster Cheese on Rye Bread.  My wife had the 1/2 Corned Beef Sandwich with cup of Matzo Ball Soup.  Both came with a side order of fries.  The sandwiches were ok, not great.\n\nMy sandwich had a ton of meat on it.  I don't really like it when the meat is piled too high.  It tasted good but it didn't blow me away and leave me wanting more.  The fries were not good at all.  They tasted a bit stale and cardboard-ish.....no real flavor to them.  We tried to get chips instead of the fries but were told it would be an additional $2 for chips...what?  For a small 4 oz bag of Lay's?  Fuggetta 'bout it!\n\nMy wife enjoyed her cup of Matzo Ball Soup....again, not blown away.\n\nBecause this place is located in a casino, their prices are pretty high.  My sandwich was $13.99 and the 1/2 sandwich & cup of soup was $9.99.  Kind of high for so/so food.  Good thing my friends were paying for lunch....otherwise I would have been upset.\n\nWill I return?  Probably not....unless I was starving and my friends paid for the meal.",

    "text": "***UPDATE 7/27/2010***\nI workout at the 24 Hour Fitness next to Chronic Tacos and came out to find Chronic Tacos flyers on the cars in the parking lot, including mine (see pics).  That's lame, taking to sleazy nightclub tactics to promote the business....blech!  One more reason not to go there for me.\n\n***ORIGINAL REVIEW***\nI passed by this place yesterday after having lunch at Upper Crust Pizza....it was very busy and looked cool, so I said I would try it the next day.\n\nWell....I stopped by for lunch after a workout at the gym.  It was 12:15 pm and there was a big line of about 20 people.  I decided to wait it out and see what everyone was waiting for.  While I was in line, it grew to about 30 people.\n\nThe place is decorated like a teenager's bedroom.  The walls are made of plywood and you are encouraged to tag up the walls with whatever (see pics).  I think the owners are MMA fans because there were MMA magazines all over the place and the guy who brought out my food had a MMA T-Shirt & hat.\n\nFood - I was going to try a Carne Asada burrito, but I wanted to try 2 dishes, so i opted for the Nachos (no meat) and a Carne Asada Fatty Taco.  It's a typical setup like you find at Qdoba/Zaba's/Chipotle where you order your food and you move down a line of people to add the toppings.\n\nThe Carne Asada Taco ordering process went smoothly, but the Nachos didn't....they forgot to make it as they rely on someone in the back who's not part of the assembly line to make it.  They yell out the order and I guess someone is suppose to pay attention and make it....well, they didn't.  No big deal at this point, it's only Nachos and it doesn't take a long time to make those....so, they told me when I paid that they would bring it out.\n\nI had a pretty good workout and built up a huge appetite, so I scarfed down the Carne Asada Taco while I waited for the Nachos.....it was pretty good, not great but good....nice flavor but it wasn't \"authentic\".  i guess growing up in SoCal makes you a Mexi-Snob when it comes to Mexican Food.\n\nAfter a few minutes my Nachos came out....I was surprised to see that there was only cheese on top of chips.  Normally at Baja Fresh/Qdoba/Chipotle/Zaba's nachos are fully loaded with all the toppings....hell, I even paid extra for guacamole.  I asked the guy who brought them about it, he apologized about the guac and said he would come back with a cup of it....but he said that's how the Nachos with no meat are prepared, with just cheese.  What a disappointment!\n\nTo make matters worse, the cheese is shredded cheese that they melt on top of the chips....that in and of itself isn't that big a deal....what was really a big deal is that the cheese wasn't fully melted, just the top of it so it didn't stick to the chips and it fell all over the place because it was still cold and shredded underneath (see pics for details).  The guacamole was bland too.  I still ate it because I was hungry.  What a bad meal....I should have went somewhere else.\n\nThe place was crowded and the majority of the people in there were younger (early 20's and teens)....I guess they like the atmosphere.  Since I don't follow MMA at all, it didn't appeal to me.....and the years of writing crap on the walls are decades behind me.\n\nI would have rated the place 2 Stars if the line was shorter...but because the hype was built up and it didn't deliver, I gave it 1 Star.  It's the 1st 1 Star joint I've rated.\n\nWill I return?  Nah.....unless someone else was paying the bill.",

    "text": "So when I asked Mom where she wanted to go for her Birthday, her response was....Yard House for Happy Hour 1/2 Priced Appetizers.....lol  I love my Mom, so we all went to this Yard House for her Birthday.\n\nWe took full advantage of the Happy Hour and ordered the following:\n\n- Hawaiian Poke Stack\n- Seared Ahi Sashimi\n- Chicken Lettuce Wraps\n- Firecracker Wings\n- Buffalo Wings\n- Pepperoni & Mushroom Pizza\n- Calamari\n\nAll of it was good except the Pizza.  The Better Half ordered the Pizza and waiting until the end to eat it.....but by then, it was soggy.  That's not the restaurant's fault, but our.  Next time I told her to eat it first or request it well done, lol.  Everything else was spectacular.  \n\nI had the Buffalo Wings which were good and had a nice spice level to it.....the sauce wasn't overwhelming and the wings had a good amount of meat on it.  I also sampled the Pizza, which was just ok, not great.  The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were also good but not great....I prefer the PF Changs style of lettuce versus the flimsy, leafy style of lettuce used here.....it just doesn't hold the Chicken well.  To wash all of this down, I was drinking a Chamay Tripel, which is a powerful Belgian beer.....it was very smooth with hints of Citrus & Bread....I love this beer!\n\nOur Son had the Seared Ahi & the Firecracker Wings.  He said the Ahi was Awesome.  I tried one of his Firecracker Wings.....they were pretty good, the dipping sauce was a little too sweet for my liking, but it was flavorful.\n\nMom had the Hawaiian Poke Stack.....she grew up in Hawaii and was happy to have a dish that resembled the homeland.  She was very pleased with her meal.\n\nWifey had the Pizza, which I already mentioned was soggy due to lack of attention on her part, lol.  She also had the Calamari, which she said was very good.\n\nThe service was good too even though the place was packed for Happy Hour.\n\nOverall, the family had a great night out.  We all went home happy & with full bellies.\n\nWill I return?  You can bet your House on it!",

Their Twitter account is:\nhttp://twitter.com/FusionTacos\n\nIf you mention that you found them on Twitter, you will get a FREE drink with your order.\n\nFrom what my friend told me, they were a little hard to find as they are located inside a little Carniceria at the back of the strip mall on the corner of Decatur & Vegas Dr.\n\nThe place is a little hole in the wall type setup.  They offer both Mexican & Asian Teriyaki Bowl type entrees.  The fusion tacos comes in 3 types....Bul Gogi (beef), Daeji Gogi (pork), and Dak Gogi (chicken) Tacos.  I forgot about these when I got there and ordered a Carne Asada burrito & a Carne Asada taco....my son ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl....go figure. (see pics)\n\nThe Carne Asada burrito was very good.  The beef was flavored nicely and the beans and rice were just the right portion....also, you can't go wrong for $3.99....that's really cheap for that quality of a burrito!  The tacos were excellent too and priced just right at $1 ea.  My son said he loved the Chicken Teri-bowl, but it was too much for him so he took 1/2 home for later.\n\nOverall this place has good value and I also like how you can get Mexican soda here....which is flavored with Natural Sugar instead of High Fructose Corn Syrup......I just can't say no to that soda!\n\nWill I return?  Absolutely!",

Yeah, it was a belly-full alright!\n\nThe Hot Links again were very solid....loaded with Cheese, Onions, and Hot Sauce.  The Buffalo Wings were good and huge!  French Fries good as well.\n\nThe restaurant was busier this time around, so it looks like word is getting around....good, because I'd like to see them around for a while.\n\nWill I return?  You bet your Hot Links I will!",

    "text": "I love BBQ and this place is located near my good friend's house.  So when he suggested we try out the new BBQ place near his house, I jumped at the opportunity.\n\nThey recently opened, so there isn't even a sign there yet....but they have a huge banner so we knew we were in the right place.  It's tucked in the corner of the shopping center, so you have to look for it.\n\nLooking at the menu, which has no beef, I was tempted by the Pulled Pork Sandwich and the Hot Links sandwich.  I couldn't decide, so I ordered both!\n\nWhile we were waiting for our food, the owner/cook gave us samples of his Baby Back Ribs, Fries, and Hot Sauce.  What a  nice guy.....the samples he gave us were awesome too.\n\nThe first dish to come out was the Pulled Pork Sandwich.....the thing is huge!  I was beginning to regret ordering 2 sandwiches...lol  Anyway, the Pork was tender and juicy and had the right amount of BBQ Sauce.  The sandwich is topped with Coleslaw, which added to the overall flavor....very good.\n\nA few minutes later came this huge Hot Links Sandwich.....I got in over my head this time....but I wasn't going to let that sandwich beat me.  The Hot Link was very good and again the right amount of BBQ Sauce was in the sandwich.  It is also topped with Grilled Onions & Cheddar Cheese.....yum.  The only thing that could have made it better was if it was spicier.....I like blazing hot Hot Links.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful too...and greeted us with smiles and when we left said goodbye....nice personal touch.  I took plenty of pics, so check them out.  They also deliver....\n\nWill I come back?  Absolutely.",

It was a pretty large serving and came topped with Cheese, Beans, Sour Cream, Guacamole, Salsa, Rice.\n\nI was surprised that they put rice on their Nachos.  I've never eaten Nachos with rice before.  It was not too bad.  I thought the rice was bland and didn't add to the flavor, but it gave an interesting texture to it.  I requested the spiciest salsa they had but it wasn't that spicy at all....I guess they make it for most Gringos.  I thought the Pinto beans were ok, but could have used a little more flavor.  The chips were not home made but were of good quality.  Overall, not bad.\n\nMy friend had a Barbacoa Pork Burrito....the portion was huge!  He liked it alot.\n\nOne cool thing they had was a large selection of Hot Sauce.  I tried a few of the really spicy ones and they packed some punch.  I'm curious about their burritos & tacos and will try them if I eat there again.\n\nWill I return?  At some point, probably....but it's not my 1st or 2nd choice.",

The Burrito was solid as usual for a Chipotle.  The Guacamole & Sour Cream makes the Burrito for me.  The Rice has just the right amount of Lemon juice on it to give it that slight tart flavor.....and the Hot Sauce has a nice kick to it.\n\nI think they do a really good job because they have such a small menu and focus on providing consistent product.\n\nWill I return?

    "text": "Cool spot to hangout after a round of golf.  It's located at the Phoenician Resort at the golf clubhouse area.  Some friends and I popped in after a round for a bite to eat and some drinks.  It was raining that day, so we camped out next to the fireplace to dry off.  We were soaking wet from playing golf all day in the rain and since it was the end of Summer, the AC was cranked on full tilt here.\n\nTo warm ourselves up we ordered a shot of premium Patron Tequila and I had a glass of Woodford Reserve Bourbon, neat.  The Tequila went down smooth and warmed me up real fast.  I savored the Bourbon and sipped it slowly while enjoying the conversation about our day of golf and other random things.\n\nFor food, we decided to order some Onion Rings ($8), Garlic Fries ($7), and Chips & Salsa w/Guacamole ($14).  We shared the appetizers.  They were very good and a perfect snack to enjoy while we hung out.\n\nOur waitress was very attentive and made sure our glasses weren't empty.  One of the guys in our group volunteered to pick up the tab because he lost a bet on the golf course....which was good because the shot of premium Patron was $45....wait, what?!\n\nOverall, it was a good time.  Next time I try the Burgers on the menu.\n\nReturn Factor - 87%",

    "text": "Was invited to a friend's Birthday party here the other night.  They reserved an area to the left side of the bar.  I loved this place as soon as I walked in.....2 Pool Tables, 2 Dart Boards, and a full sized Shuffleboard game, plus comfy chairs and a wall of big screen TVs.....perfect!\n\nThey ordered tons of food for the party....Mozzarella Sticks, Chicken Wings, Chicken Fingers, and several Pizzas.  With over 40 people coming, they needed to load up.\n\nI tried the Mozzarella Sticks & Meat Lover's Pizza.....they were both very good.  The Mozzarella Sticks were cooked just right....the Breading was crispy and not too greasy and the Cheese was melted and gooey.....it had a nice flavor to it and went well with the Marinara Sauce.\n\nThe Meat Lover's Pizza was awesome too.....from what I could tell, it had Canadian Bacon, Bacon, Sausage, Pepperoni loaded on top of the Pie.  It was very flavorful, but with all of that Meat, the crust was a bit soft, very difficult to eat the first few bites of the slice without a fork.....which is not good for Pizza traditionalists.  Other than that, it was spectacular Pizza....full of flavor and I thought the Cheese to Meat ratio was good.\n\nTo wash all of that down, I had a Hoptoberfest Beer made by Fat Tire.....very tasty, not as Hoppy as other Beers I've had recently, but very good.  It went well with the food.\n\nOverall, I had a blast here and so did the rest of the party.  People were playing pool and darts....it was too packed to play shuffleboard as the party goers were too close to the table to play a game.\n\nWill I return?  I'm considering having my Birthday Party here.",

    "text": "On my last trip to Vegas, I finally got to eat at the legendary Monta Ramen.  This place has been on my \"to do\" list since I lived here 3 yrs ago.  I've tried at least a dozen times to go, but because this place is so small, the wait is usually very long and I'm not patient enough to wait in a long line for Ramen.  However, this past trip we went at a great time in-between lunch/dinner when there was no wait list.\n\nI ordered:\n\nSmall Fried Rice, $3.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=w5AX4KwSXtzmxSEt-vej8g#w5AX4KwSXtzmxSEt-vej8g\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=391aM_l0lDis4oAtZPcTaw#391aM_l0lDis4oAtZPcTaw\n\nTonkotsu Shoyu Ramen, $7.25\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=cMExaL7ebqN31EuREScnlg#cMExaL7ebqN31EuREScnlg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=g152vHdE64gsXDp65vDoGg#g152vHdE64gsXDp65vDoGg\n\nMiso Ramen (no meat), $7.25\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=N4jGhfIm1nN5oyNe0EwrIQ#N4jGhfIm1nN5oyNe0EwrIQ\n\nThe portions here are much smaller than other Ramen places I've been to.  If you're accustomed to the large portions in So Cal Ramen joints, be warned that the portions here is about 3/4 those portions.  The Fried Rice was very good and hit the spot.  The Ramen was very good, full of flavor.  I had the Veggie Miso Ramen and it was awesome.  The Better Half had the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen and she thoroughly enjoyed it as well.\n\nOther notes:  They make the Ramen fresh to order, so it's a bit of a wait.  There's also counter seating available for convenience.  We sat at the counter and watched them make the dishes....pretty cool.\n\nDid it live up to the hype?  It met my expectations and was definitely 4 Stars in my opinion.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",

Yes, I was starvin' like Marvin!\n\nThis was the first time for me at this Smashburger location.  It was around lunch-time and it was busy.  They give you a number after you order, then bring your food out to you.  I just left the gym and wasn't in a hurry, which was a good thing because it took almost 20 minutes to get my order.  The good thing about that is that the food is prepared fresh, the bad thing is that it's not convenient if you're in a hurry.\n\nThe first item I tried was the Baja Burger....yum, it was tasty!  I could taste the spicy heat from the fresh Jalapenos.  All of the ingredients gave this Burger a unique flavor to it.  I like.\n\nNext I tried a few of the Fried Pickles....yuck, they failed on this one.  The Pickles were soft and chewy.....when they're served fried like this, the breading should have a slightly crispy texture to it with the Pickle on the inside providing the soft/chewy part.  Plus they were very greasy.....all of these factors usually means the temperature on the fryer is too low.  Needless to say, I didn't finish my order.\n\nNext up was the Chicago Dog.....I like how they split the Hot Dog in half so that it holds the toppings better.  I really enjoyed the Chicago Dog....they did it right and put together a proper Chicago Dog.\n\nOverall, it was a pretty good meal despite the fail on the Fried Pickles.  I didn't need the calories anyway.\n\nWill I return?  Probably, but not during the lunch rush hour.",

    "text": "After reading about this place in a Yelp Talk Sandwich thread, I decided to meet a few friends here for lunch.  Before we arrived, I scoped out the menu to see what I would order.  The sandwiches here are not your traditional sandwiches.  There are many non-traditional options to choose from such as:\n\nBread - Kaiser, Kimmelweck, or Black Russian Swirl\nSides - Cold Mac n Cheese, Coleslaw, Cool Potato Salad\n\nThere are no fries or chips here friends.\n\nAfter some debate, I decided to get 2 sandwiches......\n\nThe Fatboy \n(Twelve hour dry rubbed brisket on Kaiser with sliced habanero pickle, mozzarella and 'fatboy' spiced mustard sauce)\n\nThe Naked Sandwich - Tri-Tip on Kimmelweck bread, Yellow Mustard, Lettuce, Tomato.\n\nOk....The Fatboy was awesome.  Very tasty!  I also enjoyed the Naked Sandwich, but I thought the Kimmelweck bread was a bit too salty.\n\nSandwiches come with a side salad, Giardiniera vegetables, and a pickle.  I thought the salads were good and the Giardiniera was awesome!  The pickle was very good too, but I had too much food so I didn't eat the 2nd pickle.\n\nAtmosphere - The place is a hole in the wall sandwich shop, so you're expectations should be very high.  Seating is limited to 3 stools inside on a counter and 2 tables outside that can accommodate 4 people each.  You're kind of screwed if you have a large group and they're busy.\n\nParking - There are 4 or 5 spots in front of the shop....parking is tough, so carpool if you can.\n\nWill I return?  Absolutely!  I have my eye on a few other sandwiches already!",

    "text": "I was very excited to hear that one of my favorite sandwich shops was opening a Pizza joint.  So there was no way I was going to miss out on the first day they open.  I worked out for 2 hrs in the morning in anticipation of the calories I planned to consume...ha!\n\nThe restaurant is located inside Moondoggies video poker bar.  I was pleased to see that the menu was much larger than their sandwich shop....so I went big and ordered a Slice of Cheese, Slice of Pepperoni, Slice of the Pie of the Day (Royal, see menu pics for details), and an order of 3 Chicken Fingers.\n\nThe Pizza came out first.  I tried the Cheese Slice first.  It is a thick crust.  The menu calls it Buffalo, NY Style Pizza....I've  never had this style before.  The pizza is loaded with Cheese....the crust is soft and doughy, not how I usually prefer my Pizza but it was good.  There is a good proportion of sauce.\n\nThe second slice I had was the Pepperoni.  It has the small slices of Pepperoni and the best part is that the Pepperoni is slightly burnt...+1 in my book.  Again, good proportion of sauce and cheese.  Nice zing to the Pepperoni too.\n\nThe third slice was the Royal, which was the best of the 3....no wonder it was the Pie of the Day!  Cappicola Ham, Italian Sausage, Mozzarella, and Ricotta goodness all in one Pizza Pie!!!!  The meats are very tasty and fresh....this combo went well together.  I am glad I splurged and went for it.\n\nThe last thing to come out was the Chicken Fingers....they were good, not great. The sauce was Mild and the appropriate spice level.  The fingers were not the crispy style, but the soaked chewy style.  It was ok.\n\nMoondoggies is an older bar, so don't expect a great atmosphere....it's a video poker bar and it is not in the suburbs....and hasn't been Gentrified....yet. ;-)\n\nWill I return?  You bet your Naked Heiney I will!!! I want to try some of the other Pies and definitely the other Subs that they don't have at their Sandwich Shop.",

Cheese Slices are $1.95 each with $.40 ea for additional toppings.  I ordered 2 Sausage & Pepperoni slices.\n\nAfter a short wait, the Pizza came out.  The slices were huge....a little bigger than what I normally see around town.  The Pizza is NY Style thin crust.  After a few bites I was underwhelmed.  The Pizza was just OK.  I didn't really care for the Sausage and the Pepperoni didn't have much flavor.\n\nOverall, the Pizza didn't leave me wanting more.  They serve other items like Wings and Calzones....maybe I'll come back to try one of those.\n\nReturn Factor - 40%",

Luckily we found a table.  \n\nAfter a little while the food came out.  We were starving, so it had no chance to last very long.  I had the Brisket & Ribs.  The Brisket was very good....juicy and full of smokey flavor.  The Ribs were ok, not the best I've ever had, but good.\n\nI sampled some of The Better Half's Pork....that was very good too.  The Slaw is outstanding.\n\nI think this place is family owned....everyone there was nice and accommodating.  \n\nToo bad it's in BFE, otherwise I'd eat here more often.\n\nReturn Factor - 95%",

It's kind of difficult to see from the street, so the easiest way to describe the location is that it's in the shopping mall right next to the Home Depot....on the left side if you're facing Home Depot.\n\nBefore I entered, I looked on Yelp and saw that they had a Special Offer for $1.50 for Hot Chicks.....decided I would investigate further.\n\nSince this was my 1st visit, I didn't know what a Hot Chick was and was pleased to find out that it was a Fried Chicken strip on a Hot Dog Bun w/Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, and your pick of sauce.  This sounded like a winner....so I ordered 2.....one with their BFG Sauce and the other with Honey Mustard.  For a side, I ordered Baked Mac 'n Cheese.\n\nThe restaurant is a small business owned and operated by a couple of friends and their family members.  While I waited for my food, we chatted it up a while.  They are genuinely nice people, which is a huge plus for me.  They asked each and every person who came into the joint what their first name was and called them by their first name when calling the order and saying goodbye....and it doesn't sound fake either.\n\nAfter a few minutes my food was ready.  I decided to try the Hot Chick with the BFG Sauce first.  The proportion of Lettuce/Tomato/Onions was just right and the amount of Sauce on the Sandwich was just right as well.  The Chicken was moist and tasty....it wasn't greasy (bonus)....it was like a Chicken Strip Hot Dog....awesome!  The BFG Sauce is sort of like Thousand Island Dressing, but with a slightly different flavor to it....definitely worth a try.\n\nWhile I was devouring the 1st Hot Chick, I took a few bites from the Mac 'n Cheese....it was gooey and Cheesy....it's making my mouth water just thinking about it.  The Mac 'n Cheese portion size is pretty good too for $1.50.  I then went for the 2nd Hot Chick....covered in Honey Mustard Sauce....again, it was explosion of awesome in my mouth!  The Honey Mustard wasn't too sweet and balanced the flavors of the Chicken and the other toppings.\n\nOverall, it was a good day.....2 Hot Chicks & a Side of Mac 'n Cheese for around $5...isn't that every guy's dream?  Shh!!!  Don't tell my Wife!  Ha!\n\nWill I return?  There are so many other options on the menu I want to try....Grilled Chicken, Baked Chicken, and the Fries...You bet I will!",

They were busy too, so a couple of us went over to try and 'win' a table from people who were there.  I normally enjoy playing pool, but didn't feel like it on this particular evening.\n\nThe pool tables seemed to be in good shape and there is adequate room, but with people walking by, it can get a bit annoying to deal with them interfering with the shot.....the traffic flow can be improved.\n\nThere's a bar area with a lounge on the side of the bowling alley and the floor of the alley is eye level, so it's kind of cool to watch the bowling action from that vantage point.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty cool place.  Would like to come back again.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

It's conveniently located in the food court near the conference rooms, so instead of Coffee, I got a Smoothie to start my day.  \n\nMy Smoothie of choice is the Rockin' Raspberry (Raspberries, Strawberries, Banana, w/shot of Whey Protein), $5.99.  It's very tasty and serves as a sort of meal replacement instead of eating a Pastry or Muffin before our conference sessions.\n\nThe employees here are friendly and from the 2nd day of my stay started making it for me as soon as they saw me in line....that's great service!\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

    "text": "I was in the area and decided to stop by after reading @jOanne & @keith's reviews.\n\nGood thing I read the reviews first because I walked in and immediately saw the large kitchen counter where you order....there are 3 ordering stations where you order directly from the cooks.  Since I already knew about it, I walked up like I knew what I was doing....until they started speaking to me in Spanish.....then I got a little flustered.\n\nThe menu is very simple....there are only a few things you can order and it's printed in large letters above the kitchen counter (see pics).  I decided I wanted to try the Chorizo Taco & Carne Asada Taco....and then curiosity got the best of me and I went for an order of Carne Asada Fries....they are $10 while the Tacos are $2....what does $8 more get you?  I was about to find out.  I threw $2 in a tip jar on the counter in front of the cooks and waited patiently for my order.\n\nThe food is homemade and made from scratch right in front of you....including the Tortillas.  You have to grab a tray and wait for your cook to make your order because they hand it to you right after they make it.  From there, you pay at a register on the other side of the room by the door....kind of like a Cafeteria in a Hospital or Convention Center.\n\nMy cook made me the two Tacos first and told me that he'd call my name for the Carne Asada Fries.  He asked me if I wanted everything on the Tacos...I said yes even though I had no clue what that meant....after I got the Tacos, I realized that it meant Onions, Cilantro, Guacamole, and Salsa....perfect!\n\nI jumped right into the Chorizo Taco first....it was pretty good.  Good proportions on the toppings and the size of the Taco was decent, worth $2.  Next was the Carne Asada Taco....but before I could take a bite, the cook called my name for the Fries....when I picked it up I knew I was in trouble....the damn order of Fries was huge!  It must have weighed at least 3 to 4 lbs!  Seriously!  (see pics)\n\nI finished off the Carne Asada Taco...which was pretty good.  The meat was fresh and cooked perfectly....it wasn't overcooked and didn't have too much fat on it.\n\nThen I looked at the beast called Carne Asada Fries....no wonder this damn thing is $10....it can feed 4 people!  I knew there was no way I could finish it and felt bad because I was going to waste a lot of it.  I grabbed my fork and attacked it.....basically, it's French Fries (think McDonald's sized cuts) covered in Cheese, Guacamole, Carne Asada, Sour Cream, & some other kind of Cream.  The Fries were cooked just right....not too soft, not overcooked.  The flavor of the dish was awesome.\n\nI gave it my best shot, but could barely finish just under 1/2 of the plate (see pics)....great value though....could easily feed 4 normal sized human beings.\n\nThe only gripe I had about the joint was a lack of a Salsa Bar....or Hot Sauce.....I would have loved to pour some on my food, but had to do without...that's what kept me from giving them 5 Stars.\n\nWill I return?  Yep!  Next time, I'm bringing backup to help me with the Fries!",

The food was prepared pretty fast.  I only had a few sips of my Beer before the waitress came out with the Sandwich.  I took one bite and instantly became a fan.  The Bread is soft and crunchy....the crunch comes from the toaster.  The Sandwich is served hot from a toaster....which makes the flavor of the Meats come out.  The only complaint I have about the Sandwich is that the Dressing makes the Bread too soggy....if you don't eat it fast, it will fall apart on you.\n\nThe Pasta Salad is OK....too much Cheese and Dressing on it...I would have preferred it with a little less.\n\nOverall, it was a nice lunch experience.\n\nReturn Factor - 84%",

    "text": "I love BBQ and I'm always looking for a new BBQ joint to try.  Thanks to @keith I found this place.  I stopped by for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and was shocked that the place was dead.  Located inside Lucky's Lounge, a video poker bar, I expected it to be packed with people watching football....but it was not the case.  There were only 2 people in the restaurant and a handful at the bar.\n\nI decided to eat in the restaurant and sat at a table facing the TVs so I could watch the Chargers game while eating.  After looking over the menu, I decided I wanted to try the Hot Links Sandwich & the Beef Brisket Sandwich.  Both came with sides, but I didn't really want to have 2 sides and asked if I could get just the sandwich.  The server said no, so I ordered the Slaw and Sweet Potato Fries.  I almost got the Beans, but backed off.  To wash it down, i ordered Raspberry Iced Tea.\n\nAfter a short wait, the food came out.  Since I inquired about the Beans, the server brought out a small sample with my order....that was awesome of her.  I decided to give it a try before I ate the rest of my meal.....the Beans were delicious!  They were very tasty and not too sweet....instead of Bacon, they use some of the BBQ Pulled Pork to simmer in with the Beans...you can taste the Pork and I was beginning to think I should have ordered it instead of the Fries.\n\nI went after the Hot Links Sandwich next....there is no BBQ Sauce in the Sandwich, so you have to add it yourself.  I asked my server if they had a Spicy BBQ Sauce and she said yes and provided me a little cup of both the Regular BBQ and Hot BBQ Sauces.  I put a little of the Hot BBQ Sauce with the first bite....yum, it was pretty good, but not too Spicy.  I would rate the kick as Mild for both the Hot Links & the Hot BBQ Sauce.  I then tried it with the Regular BBQ Sauce...it was good too.  The Sauce is not too sweet....which is how I like it.\n\nNext up was the BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich.  I decided to put my Slaw in my Sandwich as a topping....and added some of the Hot BBQ Sauce to it.  Again, the Sandwich comes dry, so you have to add Sauce if you want that flavor.  I recommend adding the Sauce.....after the first bite I knew I was in heaven!  The Beef was moist and juicy and full of Smokey BBQ Flavor!  The Slaw & Sauce only added to the experience....I didn't want the Sandwich to end!\n\nI had a few of the Sweet Potato Fries, which were just ok....they were are little bland.\n\nOverall, it was a good meal....I preferred the Beef Brisket over the Hot Links.\n\nWill I return?  Hell yeah!  I want to try the Ribs next time and there are two interesting pseudo-BBQ Sandwiches that I want to try.",

    "text": "Was on the way home and remembered to finally stop by this joint and take it off my \"To Do List\".....thank God I did!  It was 10:45 am and I wondered if they would be open.....they were, lucky me!\n\nI was greeted by the owner and his Wife.....at least it appeared as if they owned the joint.  They were very friendly and welcoming.  It's a casual restaurant with 10 or 12 tables inside and 8-10 counter seats near the grill.  There's also a few tables outside with umbrellas if you like to dine outdoors.\n\nI browsed the menu and was getting excited with every item I saw.....Vienna Beef Dogs, Beef Sandwiches, Iltaco Pizza Puffs......WAIT, Pizza Puffs?!  Holy $hit, that changes everything....I love those things!\n\nI couldn't control myself, so I ordered a #2 Two Chicago Dogs w/Relish, Pickle Spear, Tomato, Hot Peppers, Mustard, Onions, Seasoned Salt....and Fries ($6.00)....plus I ordered a Pizza Puff ($3.50) and washed it down with a bottle of Coke Zero.  Dammit, there goes the diet!  The lady asked for my name and asked if I was dining in or taking out....I told her dine-in.\n\nI saddled up to a table and anxiously waited for the food.  While I was waiting I noticed a man with his Son sitting at the counter.  They were eating Chicago Dogs and he was telling his Son how a Chicago Dog is made and how it should taste....the owner, who was grilling it up was there telling the kid about how to make the Dog....it was awesome.\n\nAfter a few minutes my order was ready.  The lady brought it out to my table....I unwrapped both Dogs and the bag of Fries and put them together on one wrap so I could eat it uninterrupted.  She told me the Pizza Puff was still cooking so it would be a few minutes....that's pretty standard to wait for Pizza Puffs, so I didn't care.  The Dogs were covered in Mustard, which is how I like it.....if you don't like too much Mustard on your Dog, I suggest you tell them ahead of time.  The first bite was an explosion of Awesome on my taste buds....it was sooo good!  The Vienna Beef Dog was full of flavor and the combination of toppings was just how I remember the Dogs in Chi-town.  The Relish is the atomic green colored stuff you find in Chi-town.  This place is legit!\n\nThe Fries were piping hot and seasoned with a Salty seasoning....if you don't like your Fries too Salty, then I suggest you either ask for them plain or tell them easy on the seasoning.  I liked it.  It complimented the Dogs just right.  The Dogs were average size.....not too big, do don't expect a 1/4 lb Dog with the #2.  I think they offer larger Dogs with other combo meals, but not with the #2.\n\nThe Pizza Puff came out shortly after I started eating.  I waited until I was done with the Dogs before I moved over to that bad boy.  It was wrapped in the traditional Iltaco Pizza Puff wrapper.....those of you familiar with Pizza Puffs know what I'm talking about.  I bit into the greasy, flaky, doughy Crust and mmmm.....yeah, it's the Pizza Puff that I've grown to love.  Inside of the flaky, doughy Crust is a filling of Pizza Sauce, Sausage, and Cheese.  Dammit, these things are addicting and I just discovered this place....I have a feeling I will be here often.\n\nThe owners were very attentive and asked if I was ok and needed anything.  After I was finished, they asked how I liked it....I gave them the thumbs up and a big smile.  They were smiling too and said \"See you soon Peter!\"......I love family owned businesses who pay attention to their customers.  While I was there 6 or 7 people came in and they knew all of them by first name.  I hope I get to know them better too.\n\nWill I return?  This place has won my clogged artery Heart....you bet I will!  Now, back to the gym to burn off these calories.",

It came with a Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing and was topped with thin slices of Proscuitto.\n\nThe Pizza was *meh*.....it lacked flavor.  It was a \"4 Cheese\" Pizza and each of the 4 sections of the Pizza had the different Cheeses...they weren't blended.  Each section was bland.  I was really disappointed.\n\nThe Ravioli was good, but not great.\n\nOverall, it was a very average lunch....and for the price, it should've been outstanding.\n\nReturn Factor - 30%",

Based on the familiar items of SPAM, Portuguese Sausage, and other island style dishes....I'm guessing that the owners are from the Pacific Islands.\n\nI ordered the Short Stack Red Velvet Pancakes (Topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles. Served with cream cheese syrup. $5.25), which are 3 Pancakes about 8 inches in diameter each.....and a side order of Portuguese Sausage.  Mom ordered the Jalapeno Burger ($8.75).\n\nThe food came out in short order and I eagerly started on my Red Velvet Pancakes......they were freakin' AWESOME!  Wow, I was blown away with the Sweet, Soft, Velvety flavor and texture.  I should have ordered a full order dammit.\n\nI then took a few bites of the Portuguese Sausage.....it was disappointing.  I didn't enjoy the flavor of it at all and it didn't taste like the Portuguese Sausage I was accustomed to eating when I'm in Hawaii.  Bummer.\n\nMom couldn't finish her Jalapeno Burger, so she gave me a few bites.  I thought it was OK, nothing special.  Certainly not worth $8.75.\n\nOur server was friendly and on top of things.  Overall, a nice breakfast experience.\n\nWill I return?  Those Red Velvet Pancakes are calling me.....",

Decided to stop by for dinner and grab a quick bite.\n\nThe place is casual dining with 20 or so tables.  You order at the counter and they call your name when your Sub is ready.  After browsing the menu decided on an Italian Sub (Italian Sub - Genoa Salami, Pepperoni, Ham, Provolone Cheese and Italian Dressing sprinkled with Italian Seasonings) $5.59.....with a bag of Chips and a bottle of Water.  Total damage $8.42.\n\nThe girl who took my order was very new and took a while to take the order, but she had a huge smile on her face and was very friendly.....how could I not like this place so far?\n\nThere were a lot of employees working/getting trained.  My food took around 15 minutes to be prepared.....an employee apologized to me and told me they made my Sandwich wrong the first time, so they had to make a second one.  A) I'm impressed that they cared enough to make it right...some places won't.  B) I'm impressed that an employee cared enough to come and tell me about it rather than have me wait around wondering what happened.\n\nAfter I finally got my Sandwich, I took a few pics and couldn't wait to dive in.....it looked soo good.  After I took my 1st bite, I fell in love with it.....the combination of Meat, melted Cheese, and Italian Dressing/Seasoning made this Sub taste so good with the toasted Italian Roll.  The Jalapeno Chips went well with the Sandwich too.\n\nDespite the hiccups because of the new employees, it was a great experience.  They've only been open 3 days and I really like the attitude of the employees.  I hope they make it.\n\nWill I return?  You can bet on it!",

    "text": "Couldn't resist coming back here to try more of their Subs.  Last visit, I got an Italian Sub.  This visit, I got a New York Steamer (Pastrami, Corned Beef, and Monterrey Jack Cheese) w/Jalapeno Chips and a Soda.....yeah, I normally don't get Soda, but they have Coke Zero on the fountain here....so I caved, damn!\n\nAs I was waiting for my food, I noticed a huge selection of Hot Sauce! (see pics)  How did I miss that last time?  Seriously, I think I'm in Heaven!  They even have 3 different flavors of one of my favorite Hot Sauce companies (Melinda's)!\n\nOf course, I picked two bottles of Melinda's and waited patiently for my food.  After a few minutes, it was ready.  For the first bite of the NY Steamer, I didn't add Hot Sauce because I wanted to try it in it's traditional style.....it was friggin' awesome!  The Pastrami & Corned Beef were juicy and the melted, gooey Monterrey Jack went well with the Meat....of course the Bread was awesome too.  The next few bites, I added Melinda's Habanero & Chipotle Hot Sauce.....wow, it made it even better!  Then I tried the Melinda's Jalapeno Hot Sauce....good, but not as good as the Chipotle.\n\nI devoured that Sandwich like it was my last meal on Earth!  What a great experience.....that combined with the serious Hot Sauce collection elevated this joint to 5 Stars for me.\n\nWill I return?  I'm already thinking about it!",

    "text": "Stopped by this evening to attend a Tweetup at this joint.  My friend was hosting the Tweetup and I love Pizza, so why not?  I'm glad I made it!\n\nThere was a special buffet of food setup just for the event.  Salad, Chicken Wings, Baked Ziti, and of course Pizza!  The Pizzas that were available were Pepperoni, Meat Lovers, Chicken & Artichoke, and Cheese.  I ate a slice of every Pizza, a little Salad, about a dozen Wings, and a small portion of Baked Ziti.  I wasn't planning on eating that much...I swear....but the food was sooo good and the owner, Biaggio, came out and insisted that we try everything!  How could I say no?\n\nThe Pizza is NY style thin crust.....and damn it's awesome.  It folds just right and the proportion of Cheese and Sauce is perfect.  The Meat on the Meat Lover's Pizza is something else too....I don't know if I could ever be a Vegetarian.  I suggest eating the Pizza fresh as the slices can get greasy fast...especially with the Meat Lovers.\n\nThe Wings were served plain with the Hot Sauce and Dipping Sauces on the side.  Biaggio told us that the Salad Dressing/Dipping Sauces are all made from scratch in the kitchen.  The Bleu Cheese dressing was awesome....didn't have any of the others.  The Wings are battered and were cooked just right....not too greasy, which is how I like them.\n\nThe Salad was ok....I didn't have much of it though because I ate so much of everything else.  The Baked Ziti was great too.....the Cheese was gooey and full of flavor.\n\nAfter I was done eating, Biaggo brought out Fried Dough sprinkled with Sugar & Chocolate....I had to have a bite....yum!  Then he brought out a cake for his Son's Birthday....what, more food?!  I took a couple of slices home....I couldn't eat any more.\n\nOverall, the event was fun and the food was plentiful and awesome.\n\nI spied the menu and saw that they serve Breakfast too.....I don't know how I'm going to lose any weight with this place in existence!\n\nWill I return?  Are you kidding me?!  I want to try Breakfast and their Subs, and a bunch of other things on their menu....of course I'll be back!",

We patiently waited for it to be prepared and sat in the dining area and chatted with Biaggio for a few minutes.  He's a really nice guy who enjoys his business.\n\nOur Pizza came out after a short wait and we devoured it within minutes.  It is as good as I remembered!  My Son couldn't stop talking about it.  I wish we lived nearby so we could come more often.\n\nOverall, it's one of the best Pizza joints in town.  Return Factor - 99%",

I'm so glad I did.....here's why:\n\n+ The Cheese Enchiladas rock!  Priced at $14, they're not cheap, but they're damn good!  They have 2 sauces on them....Green and Red....they each have a distinct taste that make the dish explode with flavor in your mouth.  Awesome!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fjvu3PkvrTOoIjNqL1vrJQ?select=8bxEWo47aCR19UIK3eh8Dg\nThe sides of Beans & Pickled Carrot Salad is unique and flavorful!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fjvu3PkvrTOoIjNqL1vrJQ?select=c_fS-JOQv__lXA4lLY3BRw\nThese were easily the best Enchiladas I've ever had.\n\n+ Decor & Atmosphere.  From what the bartender told me, it's only been open 6 months or so.  The decor is unique...I have no idea how to describe it, otherwise I would....it feels upscale and modern, let's just say that.\n\n+ Friendly employees.  Everyone was really nice and offered suggestions on the menu.\n\n+ The Chocolate Lava Cake, $8.  Ok, I wasn't going to eat dessert, but the bartender talked me into it....I'm glad he did.  It was freakin' awesome!  However, I will warn you....it' a big portion, can easily feed 2 people.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fjvu3PkvrTOoIjNqL1vrJQ?select=hUdZO9aFRVVBbR_9IxQg-Q\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fjvu3PkvrTOoIjNqL1vrJQ?select=fViTAdL3HGNICqHPwuWx9w\nServed hot and moist, the Chocolate Cake melts in your mouth.....when you slice your spoon through the Cake, the hot Chocolate Lava center oozes out....together with the Vanilla Ice Cream on top, it makes for an awesome combo!\n\nOverall, it was a great experience.  I was told they have 2 happy hours, but forgot the times....it's an early and late schedule for them....so it can cover both early birds and night owls.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

There's a small bar sized (6 ft) pool table in the lounge as well as a few TV's so you can watch sports.\n\nDuring Happy Hour it gets pretty busy.  During my visits, I sampled the following menu items:\n\nNachos\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j-d-s-lounge-scottsdale?select=NoabkdWqBta-5RRtK-9opg#NoabkdWqBta-5RRtK-9opg\n\nPotato Skins\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j-d-s-lounge-scottsdale?select=BhrLIs6tTlghmU_u3AuU-A#BhrLIs6tTlghmU_u3AuU-A\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j-d-s-lounge-scottsdale?select=5IOo_SDPNd1AfPEdQwNzwg#5IOo_SDPNd1AfPEdQwNzwg\n\nCheese Sticks\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j-d-s-lounge-scottsdale?select=gfj_9__b4wBDoFmKVNq1IQ#gfj_9__b4wBDoFmKVNq1IQ\n\nThe food was average.  The Potato Skins were bland and quite small.  The Cheese Sticks were just OK.....so were the Nachos.  For a sports bar type lounge, that surprised me.  Usually, they get the bar food down pat.  \n\nThe service was so/so too.  One visit, it was good....the other it was bad.  There are too many other choices in town.\n\nReturn Factor - 30%",

    "text": "This place has been on my bucket for a while, going back to when I lived in Vegas.  When we had the opportunity to eat her on a recent visit, I couldn't say no.  After browsing the menu, I decided to go with the The Longhorn (Burger, Beef Brisket, Whiskey BBQ Sauce, Cole Slaw, Pickle), $16.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=l0ExJUbDA_O0mX8qkPR_2Q#l0ExJUbDA_O0mX8qkPR_2Q\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=GccYBoYbiRiDZTNsbEyRtg#GccYBoYbiRiDZTNsbEyRtg\n\nI took one bite of the Burger and fell in love with it.  The combination of Beef Brisket with the Burger was awesome.  The BBQ Sauce gave it a tangy flavor while the Slaw softened it up with a sweet, creamy flavor.....yum!\n\nOne thing though about this restaurant....the floor is really slippery.  Wifey almost fell walking in heels because it was so slippery.  While we were dining, we saw a few more people slip as well.  The floor wasn't wet or anything like that, I think it just gets slippery when it's clean....probably over-polished.\n\nDespite that danger, we'll be back.\n\nReturn Factor - 95%",

Having walked by this joint at dinner time and seen the large crowds, I was pleased to see very few people durung the lunch hour.\n\nWe were seated near the windows so we had nice sunlight coming into the room...which is rare for Vegas casino restaurants....nice touch.\n\nI ordered the Comme Ca Burger, $19.\n\nThe food came out in a reasonable amount of time and I immediately noticed that the Ketchup was homemade and not bottled....another plus.  The Burger was also a hand made patty, not frozen.  It was very juicy and delish...yum!\n\nThe server was pleasant and realized that we were at a business lunch, so she gave us our space to talk and work.  However, she remained attentive to our needs and ensured that our drinks/food were taken care of.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience for a business lunch.....good food and service.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

I resisted the temptation to ask for help to find it and spent a good 2 hours looking for this place.  I finally gave up and asked an employee who gave me directions....they're not supposed to do that, LOL.\n\nThe setup is like the typical street-side quick Pizza joints you find in major city downtown areas.  The Pizzas are pre-cooked and warmed up to order by the Slice or by the Pie.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=Z-z_DCestFY90vmHPj-iSg#Z-z_DCestFY90vmHPj-iSg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=LXFr4Kgn5aUPTV8pxEqIzQ#LXFr4Kgn5aUPTV8pxEqIzQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=JFQEuBrHJcjMJ1lqP_1HHg#JFQEuBrHJcjMJ1lqP_1HHg\n\nI ordered a Slice of Pepperoni & Sausage, my 'go to' order.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=Fk3XJrpND-_-Bu0XGSCbug#Fk3XJrpND-_-Bu0XGSCbug\n\nThe Pizza was reheated to a very hot temp and served on a paper plate.  The flavor was very good.  The Sausage slightly overpowered the Pepperoni, but they complimented each other well.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience and the Pizza was above average.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

    "text": "A couple of weeks ago, I passed by this shopping center in my neighborhood and saw the sign \"Harold's Chicken, Now Open!\".  I thought to myself \"That place sounds familiar, where do I know it from?\"......a couple of weeks go by and I forgot about it.  \n\nThen, the other day I was starving and looking for a new joint to check out.  I looked on my Droid Yelp App and started doing a search for places....that's when I saw a review from Aljamin S on this place.  As soon as I read it, I remembered where I saw Harold's Chicken before.....in Southeast Chicago a couple of years ago.  I get really excited and call my friend in Vegas that's from Chicago who took me there.....he got excited and told me to get over there ASAP to check it out.\n\nWhen I pulled up, I saw a sign that mentioned they were from Chicago...I got excited.  I asked the cook who was standing next to the cashier if they were the same Harold's Chicken from Chicago...he said yes....JACKPOT!\n\nI eagerly ordered the 1/4 Chicken Dinner w/White Meat & Hot Sauce (2 Wings, 1 Breast, Fries, on top of a slice of White Bread, $5.99) and a Pizza Puff ($3.15).  After a short wait, they brought out my meal.....I opened up the bag with the Chicken and the smell of the Hot Sauce burned my sinuses....yes!  I couldn't wait to take a bite.  The Chicken and Fries drenched in Hot Sauce with the White Bread on the bottom to soak in the flavors was just as I remembered it in Chicago.  The Chicken was delicious and full of flavor.....my Hot Sauce tolerance has elevated since the last time I ate at Harold's, so the Hot Sauce tasted more mild to me than I remember....but it was good!  The Fries were soggy with the Hot Sauce....I forgot they did that and would have preferred them dry, my bad  I should have asked them to do that.  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!\n\nNext was the Pizza Puff....if you've been reading my reviews for a while, you'll know I love Pizza Puffs and will order one any time I can find it.  They serve the Il Taco brand Pizza Puffs here....which is what I'm familiar with from Chicago.  mmmm......Pizza Puff goodness, yes!  If you are unfamiliar with a Pizza Puff, imagine a wallet sized pocket of Pizza Dough, with Pizza Sauce, Cheese, and Sausage in the middle.....it's not a Calzone because the crust is much thinner and it has a distinctive taste and flavor to it.  It's also deep fried....although you can bake it as well.  Anyway, I suggest you try one if given the opportunity.\n\nOverall, it was an exciting day.  I called all of my Chicagoland friends who are transplants in Vegas to tell them about this place.\n\nWill I return?  Oh yeah!",

    "text": "Located in Old Town Scottsdale, I've been to this location a few times to meet colleagues for lunch.  It's a trendy spot for people to have lunch as it's always packed no matter what day it is.\n\nMy favorite lunch item is the Turkey Ciabatta (Gouda Cheese, Smoked Bacon, Sweet Tomato, Roasted Red Pepper Aioli), $11.  It has a perfect blend of ingredients that has a combination of smoked & sweet flavors with the Turkey.  This is great for lunch because it's satisfying, but does not weigh you down during the afternoon.\n\nOne of these days I will have to come back for dinner.  I tell myself that every time I have lunch here, but always seem to forget about it when we're looking for places to eat.\n\nReturn Factor - 85%",

This place is awesome for hosting parties.  \n\nThe staff greets you as you walk in and immediately offers you a glass of Wine or Beer.  Hors d'oeuvres were passed by servers.  I had the Kobe Sliders and Flatbread....they were awesome.  The Wine was very good too.  On the patio there are very comfortable chairs and sofas.  They even have a couple of those chairs that hang from ropes....very fun to sit in and have a couple of glasses of Wine.\n\nCigar smoking was allowed on the back patio....a few people took advantage of it and the awesome weather we had that night.\n\nOverall, I was very impressed with this restaurant and their staff.  I want to come back and have dinner.  Their service is definitely 5 Stars and the food is a solid 4-4.5 Stars.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

    "text": "Part of my Pizza Bender 2011 Edition, I stopped by this place and decided to give their 2 Slice special a try.  2 Slices of Cheese Pizza & a fountain drink for $5.....pretty good deal.  I added Sausage & Pepperoni for an additional $1 ($.50 per topping).\n\nThe joint is decked out in Boston photos and memorabilia.....be prepared to get a talking to if you walk in here with other sports teams gear.  A guy with a Lakers hat was catching some guff from the owner.  It was all in good fun and they were both having fun talking a bit of trash about the other team.  Hilarious.\n\nAfter a few minutes my Pizza came out.  It's a thin Crust variety, very similar to NY Style.  I'm not calling it NY Style because it's a Boston Pizza joint.  The slices are pretty big and you have to fold it if you want to eat it with your hands.....I like it better that way.  The Pizza was pretty good....above average.  I thought the Sausage was much better than the Pepperoni.  The Pepperoni wasn't anything special.  The Cheese was gooey and had good flavor.  I didn't have to add anything to the Pizza, I enjoyed it as is.\n\nOverall, It's a pretty good Pizza.  If I could, I'd give it 3.75 Stars, but I'm rounding up here.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%....would be higher if I lived nearby.",

If you're price sensitive, this is not the place for you....don't even bother.  Our reservation was for 6:45 pm and it was jam packed, good thing we called ahead.  We were promptly seated in the main dining room.\n\nAfter browsing the extensive menu, I decided to order:\n\nBaby Iceberg BLT Wedge - (Bacon, Maytag Blue Cheese, Buttermilk-Chive Dressing), $9\nTwin Lobster Tails - Broiled, MKT Price\nTruffle Mac 'n Cheese, $6 (for small portion)\nGodiva Chocolate w/Vanilla Ice Cream\n\nAll of the food was excellent.  The Twin Lobster Tails were perfect and came with Butter to dip them in.  They were so good, I used very little Butter.  I enjoyed the broiled flavor on it's own.  The Truffle Mac 'n Cheese was very rich & creamy, amazing.\n\nThe BLT Wedge was very good too, but the portion was too large and I had to leave 1/2 of it because I didn't want to be full when my entree came out.\n\nAt the urging of my colleagues, I ordered the Godiva Chocolate w/Vanilla Ice Cream.  It was awesome, but very rich.  I had to split it with everyone because there was no way I could finish it after the big meal.  The hot Godiva Chocolate oozed out of the center of the Cake....and the Vanilla Ice Cream complimented it perfectly.\n\nThe service here was impeccable.  They have a great staff.  Can't wait for my next visit.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

We ordered a couple of drinks and people watched for an hour or so.\n\nThey serve a specialty Margarita here that's served in a large glass and a full Corona bottle turned upside down inside the glass, they call it a \"Beer-garita\".....it looks ridiculous.  Even more hilarious was the number of people who were walking around drinking this monstrosity....it reminds me of the tourists in Vegas who walk around with those giant tubes of Hurricanes or Margaritas....great people watching I tell ya!\n\nOur server was very attentive and made sure our glasses remained full.

Once 12 pm hits, it's impossible to find a table/seat since it's the start of the lunch rush.\n\nMy fav items to get are 7 Layer Burritos and Bean Burritos.  This location makes larger than average portions too, so you get your money's worth.\n\nThe employees here are usually friendly and helpful.

    "text": "This place has so much potential but it's inconsistent customer service prevents it from being a top notch joint.  We come here every weekend to watch college football games.  The food is decent for a sports bar.  Over the course of the season I've had:\n\nGorilla Wings - $9\n\nBasket of Fries - $3.50\n\nFully Loaded Pizza (Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Green Peppers, Mushrooms, Onions, Black Olives, Mozzarella, Parmesan and Cheddar) - $12\n\nItalian Panini - Genoa Salami, Pepperoni, Ham, Provolone, Tomatoes, Lettuce, Vinaigrette, on Sourdough Bread) - $9.50\n\nBuffalo Chicken Wrap - $9.50\n\nChicken Quesadilla - $9.50\n\nYes, the prices are a bit high...but you're in Old Town Scottsdale, where prices are high everywhere.  During the football season, pints of domestic draft Beer are cheap so it makes up for the food pricing.\n\nThe food quality is mediocre.  By far my favorite items are the Italian Panini and the Gorilla Wings served with Maniac Sauce, which is pretty hot.  The Chicken Quesadilla is ~meh~, a bit soggy and doesn't have much flavor.\n\nWhere they really fall short is their inconsistent service.  When they're not busy (during ASU home games) the service is great.  However, when they're busy (ASU road games) the staff is overloaded and can't handle large crowds.  I think it's because they hire young, inexperienced kids who have an attitude.  On at least 3 occasions I've been told \"I'm real busy right now, I'll come get your order when I can\" or \"I don't know, ask someone else, too busy right now\"....come on!\n\nThey'll never change because being in Old Town, they'll always have the business and don't have to worry about repeat, loyal customers.  If my friends didn't come here every week, we wouldn't come here as often as we do.\n\nReturn Factor - a begrudging 80%, 30% if we didn't meet up here to watch college football",

During our recent trip back to town, we decided to stop by here for a couple of drinks before we went to The Act Nightclub.\n\nFirst of all, we were happy to see that it was still in business.  Half of us ordered a glass of Wine and the other half ordered a chalice of Stella.  We hung out for about an hour and enjoyed the people watching.  Since it's located in one of the main intersections of the mall, you can see people walking around in all directions.  There were also several characters hanging out at the bar, which were fun to watch.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to have a nice glass of Wine and Beer, give this place a shot.  They also deliver to all hotels on the Strip, so take a look at their Wine menu and if there's a bottle you like, they'll take it to you.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

It was an open bar during the party, so I don't have a sense of how much the drinks are here.\n\nThe party was held in early April, so the weather for a party out on the patio was perfect.

    "text": "Living Social brought us to this place.  It's located in Old Town, near all of the nightlife.  However, it's kind of tucked away on a side street one block away from most of the action.  I've driven past this place at least a dozen times and didn't notice it.\n\nWe went during the middle of the week, when it's not full of youngsters and partiers.  When we walked in, I noticed it smelled like a college bar.....musty, greasy, alcohol-ly....Is that a word?  Those of you who've been in these kind of bars know what I'm talking about.\n\nWe tried several menu items here, Burgers, Onion Rings, Mozzarella Sticks, etc.  All of them were mediocre at best.  Perhaps I would have a different opinion and taste if it didn't smell so bad in there.\n\nAnother thing that annoyed me is the prize wheel they have in the lower bar area.  It's a giant wheel, like you see at a casino, except that it has nails and a metal strip to stop it....when we were here some college kids were spinning this thing (for no reason) and it made a god-awful sound clanging like a cowbell, but 100x worse.  Of course, none of the staff cared to stop them.....this went on for 10-15 minutes.\n\nThe 2nd time we dropped by, the air conditioner wasn't working and it was muggy in the restaurant....plus, the elevator to the 2nd floor broke down with several college kids stuck inside, so the fire department had to come rescue them.....big drama in numbnutzville.\n\nOverall, it was a terrible experience.  There are lots of better options out there.\n\nReturn Factor - 2%",

    "text": "This is easily one of my favorite Steakhouses in Arizona.  It reminds me of Vegas when I'm here.  Why?  Because it's always full of life & energy...at least before 9 pm....and the food & service is outstanding.  I've dined here several times for personal & business reasons.  Each time, Dominick's delivers in the clutch.\n\nWhen I'm entertaining clients, I enjoy dining in the back room on the 3rd level.  It's best suited for that scenario.  When I'm here with The Better Half and we want some privacy, then we ask to be seated anywhere but the bar area.  When TBH and I just want some appetizers and a glass of Wine or a late night drink, we sit at the bar.\n\nSome menu items I've had here:\n\nIceberg Wedge Salad, $10.95\nTomato & Mozzarella, $12.95\nFried Meatballs Appetizer, $14.95\n\nPetite Filet Mignon (8oz), $41.95\nFilet Mignon (12oz), $47.95\nMashed Potatoes, $9.95\nAu Gratin Potatoes, $13.95\nCreamed Sweet Corn, $9.95\n\nThe Salads are pretty hearty portions, so be prepared.  The Bleu Cheese Dressing on the Wedge Salad is very good and rich.  If you're hungry, split the Meatballs Appetizer....it's very good, but I don't recommend having it by yourself.\n\nSimply put, the Filet is awesome.  Depending on my hunger level, I will either get the petite or the regular size.  They cook it to your preference.  I like it Medium-Well.\n\nTheir sides are enough to easily feed 2 or 3 people.  TBH and I usually share an order of Mashed Potatoes or Au Gratin.  When I'm dining with clients, I usually get 2 or 3 for the table so they can sample them....the Sweet Corn is amazing.\n\nTheir Wine selection is excellent....we've had so many good ones here.\n\nThe service is outstanding.  In 10+ visits here, I've never had bad service.\n\nSome notes:\nAlthough there's not really a \"dress code\", I've heard that they won't seat people who are not dressed appropriately.  Shorts & flip-flops, t-shirts, jeans, etc....they'll probably tell you that there aren't any available tables....that's hearsay, but I'm passing it along so there are no surprises.  I've never showed up here dressed casual, so I don't have personal experience with it.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

    "text": "When I lived in Vegas this part of downtown was just starting to get redeveloped.  Since I left in 2011, I haven't seen the progress.  So, on a recent trip, I decided to check it out for myself to see what was going on.  I told The Better Half to save her appetite so we could sample some food in the area.  After walking around a bit, we decided to check out this joint.  We ordered:\n\nPad Thai Tofu, $13\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?select=2MDRNsUbJhq1-6P5SzQS6w#2MDRNsUbJhq1-6P5SzQS6w\n\nPad See Ew, $13\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?select=jwQ2r-YOmMef6Mn9yISnkQ#jwQ2r-YOmMef6Mn9yISnkQ\n\nThe food came out shortly after we ordered it and we dug into our dishes.  They were very good!  I had the Pad Thai and it had the right combination of sweet and spicy flavors...and they cooked the Tofu just how I ordered it, a little crispy.  Believe it or not, many Thai restaurants can't get that right.  The Better Half enjoyed her Pad See Ew.\n\nOur server and the hostess who sat us were very friendly and offered warm smiles despite being very busy with many demanding customers.\n\nThe only small complaints I have is that the seating in the front room is kind of tight.  We could easily hear the conversations of the tables next to us and the elbow room was less than ideal.  I felt like we had to whisper so that they couldn't hear our conversation.  Also, parking is a bit of a challenge.  You'll have to park at a nearby parking garage or casino and walk here....which isn't too much of a problem if this area is your destination for the evening.\n\nOverall, great restaurant.  Glad to see them busy and they appear to be thriving. \n\nReturn Factor - 92%",

My favorite topping is the Hot Peppers....they're legitimately hot, which is how I like it.  I can't stand it when Sandwich shops advertise \"Hot\" Peppers when in fact they're really mild.\n\nThe employees here are friendly and keep the place clean.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

    "text": "This place opened up about a year before I left Vegas and I didn't get to try it before I moved.  So on our most recent visit, we decided to stop by and give it a try.  When you walk in, you have to \"check-in\" with a nurse.  She explains that you have to put on a hospital gown to eat, no exceptions.  It was kind of cheesy, but we decided to go through with it.  We put the gown on and got seated.\n\nThe place is unapologetic about the calories, fat content, and \"unhealthiness\" of their food....I love it.  It's decorated with items that pay homage to the Burger and fast food in general.  Great atmosphere!\n\nAfter browsing the menu, we decided to order:\n\nSingle Bypass Burger w/Chili, $8.33 w/Bacon add $.92\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=uj3i3yx8JLKs3lPRgX-DPg#uj3i3yx8JLKs3lPRgX-DPg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=QQIixogPUXOCtbBApuY8uA#QQIixogPUXOCtbBApuY8uA\n\nDouble Bypass Burger w/Chili, $10.18 w/Fries add $1.85\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=iMGyagPk5P5CEFeL-i2MTg#iMGyagPk5P5CEFeL-i2MTg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=d9VovEyM0XKeZtaXLsxx-g#d9VovEyM0XKeZtaXLsxx-g\n\n24 oz Old English 800, $4.62\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=XlYk2VgSXo9EnsgDwaW2KA#XlYk2VgSXo9EnsgDwaW2KA\n\nWhile we were waiting for our food, we saw some people getting spanked really hard with a paddle by their nurse server....what the heck is going here?  We soon discovered that if you didn't finish your food, you'd get spanked really hard by your nurse....LOL!  You can't make this stuff up!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=cUc5xHa4bttx2mE06C8WAg#cUc5xHa4bttx2mE06C8WAg\n\nPeople were getting spanked like crazy throughout dinner....some people did it just so they could get pictures taken and posted on social media.  In case you don't have a social media account, they have a camera that takes your pic while getting spanked and posts it on their account for you...genius marketing tool.\n\nAfter a short wait, we got our food order.  The 24 oz can of Old E came in a paper bag that says \"Feeling Ghetto?\"....LMAO, yep I sure did.  Hilarious.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=XlYk2VgSXo9EnsgDwaW2KA#XlYk2VgSXo9EnsgDwaW2KA\n\nI bit into my Double Bypass Burger....it was very good.  The Chili reminded me of Tommy Burgers back in LA....the Burger is large and heavy....but very tasty.  The Fries are large Steak-Cut Fries....also very good.  This thing had to be a ton of calories....but it was worth it!\n\nWe both finished our meals because we didn't want to get spanked.  It was a lot of fun and I would recommend trying it at least once.\n\nReturn Factor - 85%",

I've been here a few times, and here's what I've tried:\n\nBueno Burger (Guacamole, Salsa, Jalapeno Relish, Bueno Sauce, Lettuce), $6.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bueno-burger-scottsdale?select=kWewQ-xSnrT41cAiz4nf9Q#kWewQ-xSnrT41cAiz4nf9Q\n\nBean & Cheese Burrito, $4.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bueno-burger-scottsdale?select=YLd7kIlPXgOv0gV4oGesXA#YLd7kIlPXgOv0gV4oGesXA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bueno-burger-scottsdale?select=bptdJoBB5ihOYMKDZxOypw#bptdJoBB5ihOYMKDZxOypw\n\nQuesadilla, $3.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bueno-burger-scottsdale?select=jGaSLpAupuiiDelOxf34vw#jGaSLpAupuiiDelOxf34vw\n\nThe Quesadilla is so/so, but the Bueno Burger and Bean & Cheese Burrito rocks!  The Burger has a nice sized portion of Guac in it...they don't skimp here.  \n\nThe Bean & Cheese Burrito is made with Black or Pinto Beans, not Refried Beans, and it tastes sooo good!  It also has Sour Cream and Rice in it....which tickles your taste buds.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty good dining option for quick eats.  I will continue to come back.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

I've setup lunch meetings and happy hour get togethers here....it seems to work well for us.  I've tried the following menu items:\n\nPepper Bacon Cheeseburger - $11.50\nSliders - $8.95\nUltimate Nachos - $9.95\n\nOut of the group, my favs are the Nachos and the Cheeseburger.  The Nachos are pretty large and can easily feed 2 people....although I took care of them by myself, ha!  The Pepper Bacon Cheeseburger is full of flavor and the spice from the Pepper on the Bacon compliments the juicy Burger very well.\n\nThe Sliders are pretty good as well.  It's a good lunchtime option.  There's plenty of parking at the mall and it's conveniently located at the West end of the mall, so you don't have to walk around too much to get there.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

    "text": "I've dined at their Old Town location before, but this was my first time in their North Scottsdale location.  We dropped by for lunch on a Sunday around 11 am.  It was starting to get busy with people showing up to watch football games.  There's plenty of TV's throughout the bar, dining room, and patio areas....perfect for watching football.\n\nAfter browsing the menu, we ordered:\n\nO-Lineman Burger (Burger Patty slammed between 2 Grilled Cheese Sandwiches), $14\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-scottsdale?select=HzI9n1OxR5CbBpWmEOpyOQ#HzI9n1OxR5CbBpWmEOpyOQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-scottsdale?select=sA0zZbBfpjzszeejtS7Tkw#sA0zZbBfpjzszeejtS7Tkw\n\nPrime Rib Sliders, $12\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-scottsdale?select=Z0ntlX976Cu26SoDT72d0w#Z0ntlX976Cu26SoDT72d0w\n\nOpen Pit Burger, $12\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-scottsdale?select=4SuLfJfnGNk4DkYfwT5ZVw#4SuLfJfnGNk4DkYfwT5ZVw\n\nHot and Smokey Mac n Cheese, $12\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-scottsdale?select=uzjQ397lgcf3lgwwRTarrQ#uzjQ397lgcf3lgwwRTarrQ\n\nKiddo had the O-Lineman Burger, which was massive!  He's a growing boy though and easily man-handled it.  He loved it.\n\nI had the Open Pit Burger...it had a lot of flavor.  The BBQ Sauce complimented the Burger well.\n\nMom had the Prime Rib Sliders....she really enjoyed them too.\n\nWe all split a side of Hot & Smokey Mac n Cheese....the diced Jalape\u00f1os that were mixed into it gave it a nice spicy bite....yum!  It's a healthy portion that can easily be shared between 2 or 3 people.\n\nService here was so/so....I had to flag down the server to refill my Beer glass....food came out hot and fast and our orders were taken right after we sat down....it was the refills that were problematic.\n\nOverall, I like this location.  It's more laid back than the Old Town location, which is more of a party atmosphere.\n\nReturn Factor - 95%",

WRONG!!  \n\nThis place is totally different from the Scottsdale location.  The menu is different, the vibe is different.  What a weird experience....but it was good.  The food is very good, I had the Spinach Tortelloni....yum!  I washed it down with a glass of Vino.  Their Wine selection is decent, I had the Super Tuscan.\n\nService is good, but the parking is tough....parking is always challenging in this area, especially when it's busy.

I get it well done.  They serve it on a little rack so the Crust doesn't get soggy....genius!\n\nThe Quattro Formaggio Pasta is what I get when I'm super hungry....it's very rich and filling.  Unless you bring a big appetite, plan to bring home a box if you order this dish.\n\nThe servers here are super nice.  They remember us and know that we enjoy a glass of Wine or 4 when we have dinner, so they offer up a glass immediately.  One server already knows and brings out the glass when she greets us....oh yeah!\n\nReturn Factor - 98%",

It comes with Pretzel Bread, which makes this Sandwich unique and delish.  There's a healthy serving of Ham too as you can see from the pic I took.....it really should be called a \"Chicken and Ham\" Sandwich.\n\nMy colleagues had the Prime Rib French Dip and the Burger....they both said it was awesome.\n\nThe best part of our dining experience was our server.  She was very helpful and helped us play a practical joke on another table of colleagues that were dining across the restaurants.  She was great.\n\nOverall, this is a solid restaurant.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",

However, what you can expect is a different take on old classics served in a hipster environment.  I met a colleague here for dinner and I ordered:\n\nGuacamole, $10.75\n\nVasito de Elote (Grilled Corn, Butter, Mayo, Cotija Cheese, Tapatio Salsa, Cilantro, Lime), $5\n\nCarne Asada Burrito, $15\n\nMargaritas, $6\n\nThe Guacamole i served table-side and is very good.  It's rich, so if you're not sharing it, order the half portion.  The Carne Asada Burrito is also very good.  When I asked the server \"What's a specialty here that I must try?\", he said the Vasito de Elote...which is a Grilled Corn appetizer.  I followed his lead and tried it...it's amazing!  A rainbow of flavors explode on your taste buds when you eat it....Sweet, Buttery, Tangy, with a little Spice...yum!\n\nThe Margaritas here rock.  Very tasty...I think I put down 5 or 6, I can't remember.  Good thing I wasn't driving.\n\nOverall, it was a very good experience.  It's definitely on my rotation to take clients and colleagues.  The only downside to this place is the parking.  Parking is no bueno, but that's a problem everywhere in Old Town Scottsdale.\n\nReturn Factor - 95%",

When a colleague called me up to go to lunch and said \"hey, let's go to Grassroots\", my immediate response was \"dude, that's not one of those healthy vegan places is it? because I don't like those kind of restaurants\".....he laughed and said \"trust me, this is your kind of place\".....he was right.\n\nWe met around 11:30 am for lunch and the parking lot in the shopping center it's in was jam packed.  When it's mid-day in Arizona, the last thing you want to do is park far away from the restaurant and walk in dress clothes to/from your car....it's too hot.  In this case, I had to park really far away in the parking garage.  The parking situation gets 1 Star.\n\nThe food and service on the other hand gets a solid 4 Stars.  I decided to go with the Smoked BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich w/Fries, $13.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grassroots-kitchen-and-tap-scottsdale?select=Fd9b4bUF72Anw5bE3sFiZA#Fd9b4bUF72Anw5bE3sFiZA\n\nI immediately fell in love with the Sandwich after 1 bite.  The Cole Slaw that was put on top of the Brisket was the perfect compliment....this thing is full of flavor.  However, it was messy...I don't recommend it for a business lunch.....I am trying to stop ordering messy menu items during business lunches, but for some reason I can't stop.  Good thing I didn't get any on me.\n\nOur server was attentive and friendly.  Despite the joint being packed for lunch and crazy busy, she was able to ensure we were well taken care of.\n\nTip - Ask for a table away from the front door.  There are several tables near the front door and we sat at one of them.  Since it's so busy, there are 2 things about those tables that are bad....the constant opening of the door lets in the 400 degree convection oven air from the Sonoran Desert and it's very hard to stay cool....the other thing is that when people wait for their table, they're almost on top of you.\n\nThat said, next visit we'll sit in the back.\n\nReturn Factor - 85%",

The Cheese Sticks and Burger are so/so.  The Cheeseburger is average.  The Twin Peaks Sundae is huge and very good...the highlight of their Dessert Menu.\n\nOverall, it's an average place to me.  The TnA factor doesn't do anything for me at all....as a married guy, to me it's pointless.  Most of the girls are super young and are \"faking\" it when they come up to your table, so to me it doesn't add to the experience at all.  If that's your deal, this place is for you.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%",

The big deal is that they had the Pac 12 Network here, so we could watch all of the Pac 12 games all season long.  They no longer have the dart machine, which is a major bummer....but the food is great.  The owner is originally from Chicago and boy do I love Chi-town food!\n\nHere's a few of the menu items we've had here:\n\nPizza Puff\n\nItalian Beef Sandwich\n\nPizza\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sports-grill-101-scottsdale?select=stYoZF-lpKxKkoYaAR7H4Q#stYoZF-lpKxKkoYaAR7H4Q\n\nNachos\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sports-grill-101-scottsdale?select=7xuYCkVon4E5M4y0_djsmg#7xuYCkVon4E5M4y0_djsmg\n\nGarlic Knots\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sports-grill-101-scottsdale?select=31Ry-jyqVvm9KbBsVFlGqw#31Ry-jyqVvm9KbBsVFlGqw\n\nBy far, my favorite items are the Italian Beef Sandwich, Pizza, and of course the Pizza Puff.  The Italian Beef w/Giardinere is simply awesome.  The Pizza very good....thin crust and crispy, I order it Well Done.  The Pizza Puff is the legit ILTaco brand, which reminds me of the Windy City.\n\nThe employees here are super friendly and will try to accomodate you if you want to change a TV to watch your team play.\n\nLike I said, the only bummer is that they removed the dart machine....we enjoyed playing darts there from time to time.

I love Coke Zero, but it's damn hard to find in restaurants.\n\nSome items I've sampled here:\n\nBean and Cheese Burrito, Regular $3.35\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/americas-taco-shop-scottsdale?select=0JU25g8PgSIPYiZxDdjbAw#0JU25g8PgSIPYiZxDdjbAw\n\nAl Pastor Burrito, Regular $5.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/americas-taco-shop-scottsdale?select=O8QF__8FWHj6MODZax5duA#O8QF__8FWHj6MODZax5duA\n\nCarne Asada Burrito, Large $7.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/americas-taco-shop-scottsdale?select=VAyveM7JLoJRRBBXZbVWMg#VAyveM7JLoJRRBBXZbVWMg\n\nThe Bean & Cheese Burrito is fantastic....easily one of the best I've ever had.  I think it's because they make it Lard-Free.  Also, the Cheese they put in the Burrito is addicting....I don't know what it is, but it's got me good.\n\nThe Al Pastor Burrito has a unique taste to it.  It's unlike any Al Pastor I've ever had.  It's a lot drier than I'm used to and it's kind of crunchy....I wonder if they grill or fry it before they put in in the Burrito?  It's definitely unique and good, but don't expect a traditional Al Pastor if you order it otherwise you might be disappointed.\n\nThe Carne Asada Burrito was just average to me.  I was expecting more from it, but it just didn't blow me away.  I might have to give it another try just to make sure, but I can't stop ordering the Bean & Cheese or Al Pastor Burritos, so I don't know if I will give it a 2nd chance....LOL\n\nThey have a variety of bottled Hot Sauce options on the table, but lack a Salsa bar....wish they had that.  The bottled Hot Sauce options are very good though.  The green stuff will kick your heiny, but is very good.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/americas-taco-shop-scottsdale?select=GlYesCsPJSqwBgVlsx1vLQ#GlYesCsPJSqwBgVlsx1vLQ\n\nReturn Factor - 95%",

They were cooked properly with a nice, crisp shell.  However, they lacked flavor....were kind of bland.\n\nThe Pho Tai Chin was not good.  The noodles were clumped together at the bottom of the broth....hmmm, that means they were sitting around a while and then hot broth was poured on top of it.  It too lacked flavor.  Also, the Brisket was tough, not tender.  The Lean Rare Steak was good though.\n\nThe Wine was cheap and was also of poor quality.\n\nOverall, this place was very disappointing.  The search for quality Pho in Phoenix continues....\n\nReturn Factor - 10%",

My favorite items are the Pulled Pork Quesadilla, Hickory Smoked Wings, and Rueben.  \n\nThe Pulled Pork Quesadilla surprised me...I've never had one before that I liked, but theirs is fantastic.  It's also very filling.  I don't recommend getting it as an appetizer unless you have 3 or 4 people.  If you eat two pieces of it, you'll be full.\n\nThe Hickory Smoked Wings are very good...and addicting.  They have a sharp, smoky flavor and the Meat is moist and holds the flavor well.  I highly recommend trying these.\n\nThe Rueben is pure heaven.  They use Marbled Rye here, which is my favorite.\n\nOverall, this place does a good job.  They have friendly servers and there's plenty of big screen TV's all over the place, so it's awesome to watch a game.\n\nReturn Factor - 91%",

It's located on the North end of the Quarter, so I recommend parking in the North Garage.  \n\nThey're known for their Tacos...and they deliver the goods!  Some of the menu items I've had here are:\n\nNaked Guacamole (Hass Avocado, Cilantro, Lime, Onion, Serrano, Tomato), $8.75\n\nChorizo and Mushrooms con Queso (Chorizo, Mushrooms, 3 Mexican Cheeses, Serrano & Scallions), $12.50\n\nStreet Taco Flight (2 each Carne Asada, Carnitas, Chicken Tacos), $18\n\nVampiro Taco (Cheese, Serrano Chile, Scallions,  Carne Asada, Guacamole, Pico, Chipotle Sauce, Cotixa Cheese), $6.75\n\nTaco Buffalada (Chicken, Carne Asada, Carnitas, Cheese, Onion, Guacamole, Pico, Radish), $6.50\n\n3 Carne Asada Tacos, $14.50\n\n3 Carnitas Tacos, $13.00\n\nMy favorite out of all of the Tacos is the Vampiro Taco.  It's full of flavor and has a unique taste to it.  The Buffalada Taco is a close second....although I think mixing all of those Meats together on one Taco is a bit much.  Their traditional street Tacos (Carne Asada/Carnitas) are very good, but I prefer eating those from a hole in the wall Mexican restaurant.\n\nTheir appetizers are very good too.  The Naked Guacamole is amazing, so is the Chorizo and Mushrooms con Queso.  Those two can fill you up though, so don't order too much food if you decide to go with one of those apps.\n\nThe service here is so/so.  When it gets busy, the attentiveness of the servers declines....and this place gets very busy, especially at dinner time and happy hour.  Whenever it's busy, we have to wave down our servers to keep our glasses full, order more Wine, etc.\n\nThe vibe here is pretty cool too.  When the weather is great, the patio is a nice place to be.  However, when it gets hot and the misters turn on, it can be a bit too much.  The misters on the patio pump out a lot of water....too much in my opinion.  It's kind of funny because it looks like a tropical rainforest when they turn on the misters in the middle of the Summer heat....there's a massive \"fog\" and it can get you a bit soaked.  I joked about it with a bartender one night and he said that the misters are controlled by the shopping mall and not by the individual businesses, so they have no control over it.  Oh well, it makes for great people watching.\n\nReturn Factor - 95%",

So what happens?  They bring it out with the Pizza.  When I mentioned it to the runner, she said \"It wasn't input that way\" and walked off...no apology, ok.  I don't know why servers don't take notes...whenever a server stands there and tries to memorize our order, I know it will end up screwed up 80% of the time....they'll forget a detail or two.  Write it down and get it right!\n\nSo the service here is less than stellar.  Good thing the food is good.  The Proscuitto, Figs, and Mascarpone Cheese Bruschetta is awesome...full of flavor.  The Roasted Pepper Bruschetta is a little bland though, so I'd pass on that next time.\n\nThe Wedge Salad is very good and the portion size is perfect for a starter dish....I don't know why that server thought I wanted it as an entree...I don't look like a small Salad entree type guy.  \n\nThe Pizza is pretty good....above average.  The ingredients are fresh and the Crust is cooked just right when we ordered well done.\n\nOverall, this place has 3.5 to 4 Stars for the food.  2 Stars for the service.  Will have to come back and see if it improves.\n\nReturn Factor - 75%",

They don't cook them crispy here, the skin is a little 'rubbery'....flavor is good though.  I think if they cooked them longer it would be better...just my opinion though.\n\nTheir best items are the Sandwiches....Burger, BBQ Pork, and Prime Rib are all very good.  The BBQ Pork is topped with Cole Slaw and is full of flavor....that was my favorite out of the 3.\n\nThe Nachos were \"meh\"....tasted like Nachos from a Stadium.....not much there, very plain and below average.\n\nThe service here is below average.  Every visit, we came around 6-7 pm when it was slow and the bartender was serving us.  She took our order, etc and that was fine....but I had to walk up to the bar to ask for re-fills on our Water, Wine, and Beer....no bueno.  I get it, this is a dive-bar type place and all they cater to that younger, partier who doesn't care about regular restaurant service.  That's why I decided to give it 3 Stars....I have to remember where I'm at and manage expectations walking in.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%",

I realize there are cheaper Sandwich shops, but Which Wich has their own style and flavor.  Their sauces and toppings are better than average and the Bread is very good.

Tucked away in Old Town Scottsdale, this place doesn't get as much foot traffic as the entertainment district.  However, in my opinion it's much better than most of those bars.\n\nThe big deal for me here is their large selection of Craft Beer and Imported Beer.  The specific Beer that made us choose this place is Chimay.  A couple of us wanted to introduce Chimay to our colleagues and this place has more than 1 on the menu....score!  Add to that a warm, living room feel and very friendly employees and you have a winner.  \n\nI didn't get a chance to sample the food, but I will on my next trip.\n\nReturn Factor - 97%",

He suggested this place.  \n\nAfter a quick look at the menu, I decided on a Buckwheat Belgian Waffle w/Vermont Maple Syrup, $12.  To wash it down, I ordered a Coffee and Water.\n\nThe server brought out a mini-pot of Coffee so that we could refill our cups at our leisure...bonus, I like when a restaurant offers that.  After a short wait our food was served.\n\nI poured a little Syrup on my Waffle and took a bite....it was a little disappointing.  The texture was good and it was cooked just right...however, the flavor fell flat for me.  It tasted too \"grainy\"....not in the rough texture sense, but in the bitter, wild grains sense.  It wasn't what I expected....even the Syrup couldn't save it.  I only ate 1/2 of the Waffle.  Looking back on it, I'd like to try it with an IPA....it might go well with a bitter Beer like that and I love IPA's.  That would be weird though, ordering a Waffle at breakfast and a tall glass of IPA...ha!\n\nOur server was great and the place is very well kept.  If I come back, I'll be sure to try something that I'm more familiar with.\n\nReturn Factor 50%",

They just added Stone IPA on the Beer menu, which is one of my favorites.  \n\nWe enjoy coming here because it's relatively big and comfortable.  There are large sofas and love seats sprawled through one section of the bar, so there's plenty of room to relax.  The bar top is very wide, so there's plenty of room for your drinks and food.  There's even an outdoor area when the weather is nice....something for everyone.  That's why we like to come here....very few complaints from our clients and colleagues when we choose to meet up here.\n\nWill have to try the food one day.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

I like it.\n\nDuring our two visits here, we tried:\n\nHouse Special (Pepperoni, Sausage, Ground Beef, Ham, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Mushrooms, Black Olives, Roma Tomatoes, Green Peppers, Onions, topped w/extra Mozzarella), $26.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mellow-mushroom-phoenix-2?select=9XuiW17WjeloTCQUd-gyCw#9XuiW17WjeloTCQUd-gyCw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mellow-mushroom-phoenix-2?select=UJppfQQonTwikS553xL1-Q#UJppfQQonTwikS553xL1-Q\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mellow-mushroom-phoenix-2?select=vgxCtTkRnu02WvzwcfsJew#vgxCtTkRnu02WvzwcfsJew\n\nMighty Meaty (Pepperoni, Sausage, Ground Beef, Ham & Applewood Smoked Bacon), $25.89\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mellow-mushroom-phoenix-2?select=19deUqqiqpGt-6qo2kZhAA#19deUqqiqpGt-6qo2kZhAA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mellow-mushroom-phoenix-2?select=05fn4-RMWA5yQ05HOs5lYA#05fn4-RMWA5yQ05HOs5lYA\n\nThe House Special was a bit too much for me.  There's too many toppings on the Pizza.  I like my Pizza well done, which is what we ordered, but because it has a ton of toppings, the Pizza was still very wet & soggy.  The flavors of the toppings clashed with each other....too much to handle in my opinion.\n\nThe Mighty Meaty is much better.  The flavor of each of the Meats stands out and tastes well together.  It's a much better Pizza than the House Special if you like your Pizza well done.\n\nThe service here was hit/miss.  One visit, it was outstanding....the next visit, it was a little slow and we had to wave down our server.\n\nIf it was closer to our house, we'd probably visit more often.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%",

    "text": "For my 1500th review, wanted to review a really good restaurant.  We were lucky enough to stumble across this place recently.  As soon as we saw the menu, we knew we found a slice of Heaven!  We were seated in the back dining room and the server explained that the food was served \"tapas style\", meaning that whatever was prepared first would come out....therefore, it wasn't your traditional appetizer-entree-dessert type setup.  OK, we were good with that.  \n\nAfter browsing the menu, we ordered:\n\nFocaccia di Recco (Ligurian style baked Focaccia, Soft Cow Cheese, add local Honeycomb), $16.....this was ridiculously good and filling.  We didn't realize how much food this was and we were only on our 1st item!

The Focaccia de Recco is absolutely fabulous....and filling!  It's a must-have.  After having the first item come out, we realized that we ordered too much food...but it was too late, so we decided to have a tasting dinner and take some home.\n\nEverything was full of flavor and had fresh ingredients....our taste buds were going crazy! Besides the Focaccia, my fav's were the Gnocchi, Ribs, and Pizza.  The Cauliflower Steak was very good too, but wow is that a huge portion!  The Pork Belly was also good, but very rich....a good item to share with a group.\n\nOur server was excellent and attentive all night long.  She helped us select our items and was very friendly.\n\nThere was only 1 complaint about the evening....we were seated in the back dining room with 1 large group that we think was there for a Wine dinner.  Since they were \"talking Wine\" and other stuff, they were loud.  The dining room has hard surfaces, there's no fabric or anything there to soften the sound....so needless to say, we heard all about their Wine flight, where it was made, and such and such....they group got louder as they consumed more Wine....that's to be expected.  Next time we go, we'll ask if there's a Wine dinner or large group and kindly ask for another table to avoid it.\n\nReturn Factor - 95%",

The Spinach Artichoke Dip was bland and the Bruschetta was *meh*....I'd pass on those next time, but since it came with the Groupon I'm glad I got to try it.\n\nThey also offer Beer & Wine here....which is a plus.  They also have Sriracha and other Hot Sauces to dress up your Pellini if you choose...the Sriracha was a nice touch and complimented the flavor of my Pellini well.\n\nI can see this catching on.\n\nReturn Factor - 70%",

We've driven by it dozens of times and finally decided to stop by and give it a try.  It was a Sunday night and there were only a few tables occupied in the restaurant.  After browsing the menu, I spotted a unique item...it's called the Vesuvio.  It's a  1/2 Calzone,  1/2 Pizza concoction....I had to try it.  Additionally, it was happy hour, so Pizza was 1/2 price!

I tried the Calzone portion first....and it was bland....the Dough, Ricotta Cheese, and Ham were good and fresh, but it didn't have a much flavor....I think if there was some Sauce for dipping or if they had Sauce in the Calzone, it would be better.  The Pizza portion of the Vesuvio was awesome...it was a Mushroom/Cheese Pizza.  It had good flavor and was cooked perfectly.  After the 1st bite of the Calzone, I started to combine a piece of the Pizza and a piece of the Calzone together to make it taste good.  Perhaps that's how I should've been eating it from the start...? \n\nThe Pepperoni Pizza was awesome....full of flavor and the thin crust was cooked perfectly.  \n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our dinner here.  I'm glad we stopped by.  We'll definitely be back for Happy Hour.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

    "text": "Dropped by here after work to meet some colleagues.  The place is situated on 7th St and it's extremely difficult to get there if you're going after work in the middle of rush hour.  The traffic is heavy and the middle \"turn\" lane becomes a traffic lane, which can confuse people and make it even worse.\n\nThen after you get there and pull in, the only option that I could see for parking was valet.  You've got to be kidding me?  Nope, that's all I found....so I parked valet.  I spoke to one of my colleagues who lives nearby and she confirmed that the entire parking lot is valet only.  The cost is free, but you have to tip, so be sure you have tip money with you when you come here.  I rarely carry cash, so it was a big-time pain for me as I had to borrow money from colleagues to tip out....save the embarrassment and bring some case.\n\nOnce you get inside, it's kind of cool.  There's an indoor/outdoor vibe and the \"yard\" aspect of the place is nice.  There was plenty of room for everyone.  The Beer offering is outstanding....I don't remember what I ordered, I asked the server to surprise me with a nice dark Beer.  The Beer was tasty and she kept bringing it all night long without reminding her...great service.\n\nI didn't try the food on this trip, it was a drinking only type of night.  If I was rating solely on drink/service, it gets a solid 4 Stars.  Gets knocked down to 3 Stars because of the parking fiasco here.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%",

In the bar area, there's a full size shuffleboard game....I haven't seen one of those in years.\n\nSince the weather was awesome, we decided to sit outside.  Once we settled into our seats, we ordered:\n\nPretzel Knots, $5\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/proof-scottsdale?select=tEOMXcR_1x4capEjfg95GQ#tEOMXcR_1x4capEjfg95GQ\n\nSpinach Artichoke Dip, $12\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/proof-scottsdale?select=cHgbvJk7pe385t5t3tmQeg#cHgbvJk7pe385t5t3tmQeg\n\nPotato Bacon Chowder\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/proof-scottsdale?select=k2VePOrtCCwCYr7nhoIWuA#k2VePOrtCCwCYr7nhoIWuA\n\nRueben, $19\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/proof-scottsdale?select=0nhrBqQLKZFsJybz5vDfUw#0nhrBqQLKZFsJybz5vDfUw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/proof-scottsdale?select=6VHXCBHgODNkyqgAlACGWw#6VHXCBHgODNkyqgAlACGWw\n\nThe Pretzel Knots and Spinach Artichoke Dip arrived first.  The Pretzel Knots are amazing!  They came out warm and fresh and have a nice Queso Dip to compliment it.  \n\nThe Spinach Artichoke Dip was bland...disappointing.  The hard, cruton-like sticks that came with the Dip were very salty...perhaps that's why it tasted so bland to me?\n\nThe Potato Bacon Chowder was outstanding.....rich and creamy, it hit the spot.\n\nFor the grand finale, the Rueben came out....and boy was it good!  My colleague ordered the same thing, except he got Onion Rings and I got Fries as a side dish.  The Onion Rings are thick and juicy....and sweet, very good.  The Fries were very good too.\n\nService here was outstanding....what you'd expect for a 5 Diamond resort.\n\nReturn Factor - 91%",

It has a nice kick to it....and tastes different than most Burgers you find out there.  The Guacamole is fresh and rich....adds a creamy smooth texture and compliments the sharpness of the Jalapeno.\n\nThe Fries are average at best.\n\nThis place gets very busy.

    "text": "I've heard about this place from so many friends and colleagues that I had to try it for myself.  So, I head into downtown Phoenix between breakfast/lunch to grab a bite.  I got lucky and found a parking spot in front just down the street....be warned though, it's metered parking and it's an old school meter, so you need quarters & dimes.  I only had enough for 45 min, so I prayed that it wouldn't be packed inside and that I could get in/out without a parking ticket.\n\nI walked in and found a seat at the bar.  I saddled up to the counter and browsed the menu.  I ended up ordering:\n\nFive Spot Breakfast Sandwich (Eggs, Cheese, Caramelized Onions, Thick Cut Bacon) w/Hash Browns, $5.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix-2?select=BnXYQfUHaR_ajW8_Wy5oUA#BnXYQfUHaR_ajW8_Wy5oUA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix-2?select=Ky1EPe539GhuY-nM_9J5RA#Ky1EPe539GhuY-nM_9J5RA\n\nThe order came out fast.  I took one bite and loved it.  It was full of flavor...the Caramelized Onions really added to the taste of this Sandwich, I was impressed.  The Bacon tasted great, but was a little undercooked for my tastes...I should've known better and asked for it to be cooked crispy, especially since it was thick-cut...my bad.  It was till a great Sandwich anyway.  Except for the Caramelized Onions, it's exactly how I'd make a breakfast Sandwich.\n\nThe Hash Browns were good too, went well with the Sandwich.\n\nThe service was great, I was in/out in 30 min....so I had 15 min to spare on the meter.  Lunch menu looks interesting, I'll have to come back and give it a try.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

They tried though.....but it was still very \"doughy\" and soft....blazing hot though, I had to give it a few min to cool off.\n\nThe flavor of the Pizza was OK....the Cheese overwhelmed it a bit.  The Pepperoni was quite small too.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty average Slice of Pizza.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%",

So, I invited a bunch of colleagues to meet after work for happy hour.  I reserved one of these tables online via their website.\n\nWe arrived and lo and behold....there are BEER TAPS ON THE TABLE!!!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dierks-bentleys-whiskey-row-scottsdale?select=kiB0dPVKVgs_o1eS0_1xmg#kiB0dPVKVgs_o1eS0_1xmg\n\nOur server informed us that to activate the tap, we have to put a credit card down and then we can freely pour ourselves or she can pour for us.  There's an iPad on the table that's connected to the tap system that shows the consumption of each type of alcohol on the tap.  You pay by the ounce.\n\nWe were super excited and we all grabbed pints and started pouring from the tap.  We were like little kids opening a Christmas present....we had giddy smiles and big eyes...it's not hard to get a group of men excited about Beer.  We watched the meter on the iPad grow as we poured more and more Beer.  There's also a tap that has a Fireball-like Whiskey for shots....later in the evening shots happened.\n\nIn between all of the drinking, we tried the Chicken Sliders, which were very good and Fried Pickles, which looked like the Fried Silkworms in China I ate a few years ago.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dierks-bentleys-whiskey-row-scottsdale?select=3qkz8IWe_fjfTsuxy2WO1w#3qkz8IWe_fjfTsuxy2WO1w\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dierks-bentleys-whiskey-row-scottsdale?select=RaSVVf-aofwsYa4wegy2Ag#RaSVVf-aofwsYa4wegy2Ag\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dierks-bentleys-whiskey-row-scottsdale?select=CXACN95KwUK8G7GoWpWQ-A#CXACN95KwUK8G7GoWpWQ-A\n\nThe service was so/so throughout the evening.  Our server went from attentive to a disappearing act...they're really young and inexperienced here, so it's to be expected.\n\nThe vibe and atmosphere is very Old Town Scottsdale....it's a party place.  As the night goes on, the more of a party it becomes.  We left around 8 pm and people were starting to show up for the later activities.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty fun place.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",

I ordered:\n\nItalian Sandwich (Capicola, Mortadella, Pepperoni, Salami & Provolone Cheese), $5\nZapps Chips, $1.10\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/potbelly-sandwich-shop-scottsdale-2?select=jvtmuI3xq1t__d2_A0IQTA#jvtmuI3xq1t__d2_A0IQTA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/potbelly-sandwich-shop-scottsdale-2?select=fz8JYiwA92ZcW2ByFPFRVA#fz8JYiwA92ZcW2ByFPFRVA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/potbelly-sandwich-shop-scottsdale-2?select=OwWJ9p-Aax_BDkUSVTnUJQ#OwWJ9p-Aax_BDkUSVTnUJQ\n\nThere are a few things that make this sandwich shop unique:\n+ The Bread is thinner than most (see my pics).\n+ They offer Hot Peppers that are like Giardiniera...and they're hot.\n+ They have Zapps Chips...very hard to find outside of the South.\n\nThe Sandwich is toasted and is very tasty.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The Hot Peppers are legitimately spicy and add flavor to the Sandwich.  I love Zapps Chips and was very happy to see it offered here for sale.\n\nThe employees here are very friendly and helpful with making your Sandwich.  The only complaint is that when I asked for a 'Big' sized Sandwich (30% larger according to their website), they said they don't have Big Sandwiches yet....what?  Why have it on your website then?  Logic would tell you not to post it on your website....or at least post that it's \"coming soon\".  Anyway, it's not the employees at the store's fault, that's a corporate office problem.\n\nThe store has plenty of indoor seating and a small outdoor seating area as well.  I was there on a Saturday at 11:15 and it was pretty busy.  I would expect them to be really busy on weekdays for lunch.\n\nI'll have to come back when they have 'Big' Sandwich options ready.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",

I also had a bite of the Chili Mac & Cheese...that was ridiculously good as well!\n\nNext, I tried the Sliders....had the Cheeseburger Slider first....also very well prepared and full of flavor.  The Prime Rib Sliders were just as good and the Horseradish Sauce was a zinger that added to the flavor!

    "text": "Finally!  B-Dubs returns to Scottsdale.  Ever since the location in North Scottsdale closed, I've been waiting for it to return.  They opened earlier this week and we were anxious to give it a try.  Since they were new, we were expecting the worst in customer service...there are always a few hiccups here and there during opening week....not here though!  \n\nWe were greeted by smiling, friendly hostesses who seated us at a table in the bar area.  We asked if they could put on a specific baseball game on one of the TV's, and they accommodated.  Our server gave us a run down of the menu & specials.  I threw her for a loop when I asked for an IPA, it was National IPA Day...she didn't know what that was.  That's ok, most people under 21 don't know what that is.  She smiled and said she'd ask the bartender and let me know.  She promptly returned and told me that they had Hop Knot IPA and Firestone IPA....I ordered the Hop Knot IPA first, then the Firestone 2nd...yum!\n\nFor dinner, we ordered:\n\nQueso & Chili Dip\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buffalo-wild-wings-scottsdale-2?select=35tWJX8t0jOppa8akUSfyQ#35tWJX8t0jOppa8akUSfyQ\n\nCheeseburger Sliders\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buffalo-wild-wings-scottsdale-2?select=MW6o7ZqiBpR3DI0Qdg4TTA#MW6o7ZqiBpR3DI0Qdg4TTA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buffalo-wild-wings-scottsdale-2?select=VcPnbq9ofF80r6IdSCM1yg#VcPnbq9ofF80r6IdSCM1yg\n\nBoneless Wings, 40 cents ea.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buffalo-wild-wings-scottsdale-2?select=mZsJCccMnqgBmSE_B6RXQw#mZsJCccMnqgBmSE_B6RXQw\n\nThe food came out rather quickly and we enjoyed our dinner while watching baseball games and shooting the breeze.  Our server remained attentive the entire time and ensured that we were good.\n\nOverall, I am very impressed with their opening week.  I can't wait to come back during football season!",
