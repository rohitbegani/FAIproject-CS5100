Our agent will run through an existing dataset, representing user’s eating behavior (cuisines, category, etc.) and learn the user’s preference model for food choices. Based on the learned user preferences, current location and time, the agent will recommend an eating choice for the user in terms of food type and the optimal place to eat. Additionally, through user’s feedback, the agent will evolve its preference model and recommendation function. We have used KNN algorithm.\r\n\r\n## Packages Used:\r\n\r\n`pymongo >= 3.1.1`\r\n\r\n`plotly`\r\n\r\nTo install all packages cd to the working directory and run,\r\n\r\n`pip install -e .`\r\n\r\n## File Structure\r\n\r\n* `lib`: Main files.\r\n\r\n* `helpers`: Contains all the helper files.\r\n\r\n* `util`: This folder contains all the utility functions.
