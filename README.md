## Introduction

**Modelling User Preferences to provide Location Based Recommendations**

This application uses KNN to create an artificial agent that can recommend eating places to a user. Our agent will parse through the user's information with an aim to understand different characteristics about the user. Then based on that we will provide different recommendations to the user. Additionally, through userâ€™s feedback, the agent will evolve its preference model and recommendation function. 

This project is our submission for CS 5100 (Northeastern University).

## Packages Used

`pymongo >= 3.1.1`

`plotly`

To install all packages `cd` to the working directory and run, 

`pip install -e .`

## How to run

1. Clone this repo to your local machine using `git clone <repo link>`

2. `cd` to the root of the directory

3. Download all the required packages using the command `pip install -e`

4. Run `app.py`. That's it!

## Graphs

The Graphs are used to show our results.

## Performance

Our algorithm gives an MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of:

- Without any restrictions on the database: `0.6`
- With time and location restrictions on the database: `0.9`

The fact that we already have a restricted database gives us a MAE of `0.6` but restricting it further changes our MAE value by a factor of `0.3`. With a deeper dataset our algorithm would give an even better MAE value. 
    

## Future Scope

This application can be extended by adding Natural Language Processing. In future, we aim to apply Natural Language Processing to a user's review and try to understand that if they do or don't like a business then what is the real reasoning behind that? Is it because of some specific thing like a lack of parking? If it is, should we stop recommending businesses which doesn't have parking space? Is it because the business doesn't have free Wi-fi?

All these factors we believe would help us in improving our recommendations and giving even better results.
