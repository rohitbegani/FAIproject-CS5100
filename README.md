## Future Scope:

This application can be extended by adding Natural Language Processing. In future, we aim to apply Natural Language Processing to a user's review and try to understand that if they do or don't like a business then what is the real reasoning behind that? Is it because of some specific thing like a lack of parking? If it is, should we stop recommending businesses which doesn't have parking space? Is it because the business doesn't have free Wi-fi?

All these factors we believe would help us in improving our recommendations and giving even better results.
